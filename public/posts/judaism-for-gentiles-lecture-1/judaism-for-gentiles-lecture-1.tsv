0	10540	Okay, so, Gary asked the first question, what is a Gentile? A Gentile is just a non-Jew.
10540	21840	So this is Judaism for not Jews. This is class number one. Was it Gary who asked me this morning about, I'm not trying to convert you?
21840	32080	Right. It's just part of your religion to come out in the public and try to educate people.
32080	43880	We don't convert people. We do not do proselytization. The only reason I'm doing this is because around Easter time,
43880	52100	we did that Passover potluck, and people seemed to have some interest in the concept of a Seder and, like, what do Jews do around this time?
52100	62300	And then people brought bread and macaroni and pizza to the Passover potluck, and Passover is the festival of unleavened bread,
62440	74940	and Jews are not allowed to eat bread or pasta or pizza. So I thought that was a little bit, um, almost like a faux pas, kind of, you know?
74940	81840	But, of course, y'all didn't know what Passover was or anything, so that's why I'm doing this class.
82640	88640	If anyone has questions about anything at any point, stop me and ask them.
89180	92780	These are some of the questions that I'm hoping to answer today.
94080	102620	So isn't Judaism just Christianity without Jesus? What's the difference? Like, isn't the only real difference that Jews reject Christ?
102620	110560	Isn't it just Christianity with more rules? Like, what you can and can't do? Like, eat bread during Passover.
111640	115860	And what's the deal with the Jews crucifying our Lord and Savior?
117120	125280	Right, so to answer the Jesus questions, we should probably start with addressing whether or not Jesus was a real history guy,
125440	129220	or just made up, I guess.
129220	133880	Um, so this is a quote from the book, New Testament History and Literature.
134240	139680	The New Testament contains contradictory historical accounts of various parts of early Christianity.
140360	144340	The account of the birth of Jesus and the origins of his family provided by Matthew
144340	146340	is totally different from that in Luke,
146800	151260	and any harmonization cannot stand up to the standards of modern historiography.
151260	154260	The different narratives of his resurrection appearances,
154880	157840	who of his disciples claimed they had seen him, when and where,
158360	161240	and Mark, Matthew, Luke, and Paul all contradict one another.
162020	166780	The New Testament is simply not a reliable source for the history of Jesus or early Christianity
166780	168660	when taken at face value.
169660	173820	This is a pretty common thing for ancient historical sources.
173820	178100	They weren't interested in hard facts the same way that we are.
178220	185900	They were more interested in presenting an interpretation of history in order to convey the right message.
186580	188800	So if a kid asks you, what's electricity?
189020	190320	How does electricity work?
190400	194900	You might answer them, um, well, you know, there's, there's power in the walls,
194900	198320	and the power goes through wires, and it makes machines work,
198460	202480	because kids aren't going to understand electricity is the flow of electrons,
202840	209340	and, uh, electrons flow from a higher to a lower voltage in order to reach equilibrium,
209340	215100	and all that nonsense, and probably most of us don't really understand how electricity works either.
215520	220740	So we present an interpretation of the facts in order to get a message across,
220740	223740	and that is probably what the gospel authors were doing.
224900	228920	And that's why there are some contradictions between accounts.
229720	233360	Well, isn't it also because it was probably oral history and so forth?
233620	238140	I mean, my brother and sister and I can get together and talk about something that happened 40 years ago.
239180	240400	That too, it does.
240400	241700	It doesn't mean a different memory.
241840	242640	So it could be partly.
242960	244940	Yeah, the Bible is probably part of it.
245060	246140	It's not univocal.
246400	248000	It's told by many voices.
248000	253520	And so there's always going to be some differences in how people remember things,
253620	255420	how people choose to tell a story.
256860	262180	But yeah, that does make it a little bit more difficult to nail down the historicity of the gospel accounts.
263200	269800	Okay, so what archaeological evidence do we have for the existence of Jesus as a historical figure?
269800	276480	This is the first pretty much not-gospel evidence that we have for Jesus.
276640	282940	It's called the Alex Aminos graffiti, and scholars date it to around 200 CE.
283660	286540	I am sure that you cannot make out any of this.
286540	289940	So, here's a sketch instead.
291980	299080	We have a horse-headed man hanging on the cross with the inscription,
300160	302260	Alex Aminos worships his God.
303140	311780	This is a sort of derogatory graffiti making fun of this Christian for worshiping a God
311780	316180	who was executed in a brutal and humiliating way.
316540	319920	So, where was it found?
320600	324700	Somewhere in the Roman Empire, but I believe the city of Rome itself.
325300	327280	It's interesting that that's a Roman cross.
327480	329140	It's not the cross that we have.
331240	333360	It's a T-shaped cross.
333360	333580	Yep.
334440	335000	Yep.
336600	343540	So, we know for sure that by 200 CE, there were some people going around worshiping a God
343540	346560	who had been executed on a cross.
347280	350220	They didn't give us a name or anything for this God, unfortunately,
350480	353460	but we can be pretty sure that it's Jesus.
353460	364660	We also have some non-Christian literary sources from the Jews in the Talmud.
365040	366140	What is the Talmud?
367100	368140	Who knows?
368200	368760	What's the Talmud?
369260	369840	You don't know.
369920	370580	We're all in trouble.
370580	373080	Is it an idol?
374480	374700	Right?
374960	375900	Not really.
376140	378540	Is it a group of people?
378540	379340	Are there the writings?
379860	381020	Is the Talmud the writings?
382520	383740	You have the prophets.
383740	390380	Okay, so you're getting at something sort of different.
390920	397080	So, the Hebrew scriptures or the Old Testament is divided into three sections.
397080	401240	The law, the prophets, and the writings.
402000	404960	The law or the Torah is the first five books.
405920	408340	The five books of Moses or the Pentateuch.
408340	415000	Then you have the prophets, the Nevi'im, we call them in Hebrew.
415640	419400	And that's Isaiah and all those guys.
419880	422400	And we have the writings, the Ketuvim.
423160	424520	That's everything else.
424620	432580	So, the Psalms, Song of Songs, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, all that stuff.
433320	436440	But that's all in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament.
438340	441320	Which we call the Tanakh, which is an acronym.
441980	443220	Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim.
444260	452480	After the Tanakh was sort of formalized, Jews kept on saying things and writing things.
452960	455700	And we collected that into a volume called the Mishnah.
456200	459620	And then they kept on saying things and commenting on the Mishnah.
459620	464980	So, we compiled that into the Gemara, which is the commentary on the Mishnah.
465180	468380	And the Mishnah and the Gemara together are called the Talmud.
468940	477020	So, this was probably written down sometime after the Jews were kicked out of Israel the last time.
477020	481800	So, before Moses separated the Red Sea?
482480	483820	Long, long after.
484300	484600	Okay.
485940	492400	Moses was, if he existed, probably a couple thousand years BCE.
492400	497500	And this probably would have been around, I don't know, 200 or so CE.
498500	503400	Around the same time that the New Testament Gospels were being written down, we were writing down the Talmud.
504620	509540	And so, that's just everybody's conversations and commentary on everybody else's conversations.
509620	511720	It's commentaries on commentaries on commentaries.
511720	516980	So, that's why the saying, like, you know, nine Jewish rabbis in a room, ten opinions.
518340	520160	Yeah, two Jews, three opinions.
522040	523740	There's actually a funny story.
524680	534220	The Old Testament translation that Jesus had was called the Septuagint.
534220	539940	It was a translation of the Hebrew into Aramaic, which was kind of the lingua franca of the time.
539940	542980	All the Greeks, the Greek Jews spoke Aramaic.
543780	547280	And it was considered at the time to be a miracle.
547640	553580	Because the Greek authorities got, like, 70 rabbis in a room together.
554880	557960	No, they got, they put 70 rabbis in 70 different rooms.
558520	559660	And they weren't allowed to communicate.
559860	562800	And they all came up with the same Aramaic translation.
563280	566960	But the Jews said, if you want a real miracle, put them all in the same room.
566960	579160	So, this is a story from the Talmud that might be talking about Jesus of Nazareth.
580180	582820	And it goes like, so.
582820	589880	So, on Passover Eve, they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning.
590180	593760	And a crier went out before him for 40 days, publicly proclaiming,
594200	597740	Jesus the Nazarene is going to be stoned because he practiced sorcery,
598100	601080	incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray.
601640	606260	Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf.
606420	608640	And the court did not find a reason to acquit him.
608640	611820	And so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover Eve.
612520	614500	Ola said, how can you understand this proof?
614580	618420	Was Jesus the Nazarene worthy of conducting a search for a reason to acquit him?
618500	619940	He was an insider to idol worship.
620440	623300	And the merciful one states with regard to an insider to idol worship,
623440	625760	neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him.
626620	629860	Rather, Jesus was different as he had close ties with the government
629860	633020	and the Gentile authorities were interested in his acquittal.
633020	636840	So, consequently, the court gave him every opportunity to clear himself
636840	639700	so that it could not be claimed that he was falsely convicted.
640720	642460	What the heck is going on here?
644200	648700	So this story is really about, um, stay,
649460	651780	about due process in Jewish law.
652660	655560	There is this guy called Jesus the Nazarene,
655560	659420	and the Jews are going to execute him for practicing sorcery
659420	661760	and inciting the Jews to idol worship.
663620	666880	And it describes a sort of due process
666880	670000	that the Jews give to Jesus the Nazarene
670000	673000	where they have a guy go out and say,
673260	675300	hey, this guy is on trial.
675640	677300	He's about to be executed.
678040	679780	Anyone who has evidence to help him
679780	682760	should definitely come forward before he dies.
682760	688040	And this rabbi, Ulla, is saying,
688600	689760	why did we do this?
690800	694240	Insiders to idol worship are not supposed to get any sort of due process.
694380	696500	We're supposed to just kill them according to our law.
696840	697960	So what's the deal?
698760	699900	And the answer is,
700440	704600	Jesus was very close to the Gentile authorities,
704760	705560	the Roman government.
706560	708220	So if we just killed him,
708620	710120	that would look bad for us,
710180	711820	and we might get in trouble with the Romans.
711820	715680	So that's why we had a crier go out ahead of time.
715880	718820	This does not sound like the gospel accounts of the crucifixion.
719460	719800	No.
721080	723900	I mean, the Jews hang him on Passover Eve.
723960	725080	That doesn't make any sense
725080	727940	because Jesus was crucified after Passover.
728720	731540	Jesus was not that close to the Gentile authorities,
731740	731820	considering...
732860	733820	They didn't like him.
733820	736980	They kneeled him to a cross, etc., etc.
737680	741160	So, what do we do with this?
741200	742620	Is this evidence of Jesus or not?
742700	743300	We don't know.
743300	749660	Here's another Talmudic story about someone named Jesus.
750460	752480	What is the word on top?
753180	756100	This is the book of the Talmud that it comes from,
756240	758940	and this is the page that it's on.
758940	765300	So, it's kind of like Matthew 7, 9, something like that.
765380	766760	Was Sanhedrin a person?
767640	769320	The Sanhedrin is the Jewish court,
769480	770900	so this is the volume of the Talmud
770900	775520	that deals with the discussions upon discussions
775520	778180	about the Jewish court,
778720	782960	and most of it has nothing to do with the Sanhedrin, actually.
783920	785660	But that's a story for another time.
788300	790980	Yehoshua ben Prechaia said,
791800	793620	How beautiful is this inn?
794240	795900	Jesus, his students, said to him,
796340	799880	But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper's wife are narrow.
801560	802720	Yehoshua said to him,
802980	803940	Look in one!
804480	807280	Do not involve yourself with regard to that manner,
807400	808960	the appearance of a married woman.
809720	812660	So he produced 400 shoferot and ostracized him.
812960	818100	So these guys, Yehoshua and his student Jesus,
818600	819620	go to an inn.
819740	821500	Yehoshua says, This inn is awesome.
822480	823380	And Jesus says,
824060	826140	Yeah, and the innkeeper's wife is kind of a looker, right?
827500	829680	That's what eyes are narrow means?
830680	835340	Yeah, she looks like a bit of a loose woman.
835340	838880	I'm like, my eyes are narrow.
842880	844240	So Yehoshua says,
844320	846580	What are you doing commenting on the appearance of a married woman?
846700	848340	Get out of here, you're ostracized.
848460	849160	We shun you.
849160	854220	What's 400 shofar?
854940	861200	A shofar is the horn that we blow at certain ritual occasions.
861660	869120	So he gets 400 people who blow shofar to officially ostracize him from the Jewish community.
869120	872400	And everybody knows it because we had 400 shofar out.
873280	874940	So he's kicked out.
875360	877180	He's pretty much kicked out for this.
877840	879080	Excluded from the community.
879180	883840	So maybe we should just say that Jesus is a very common name.
885440	886520	That is true.
886680	890480	This could be anybody's guess who this person is.
890480	898660	Jesus came before Yehoshua several times and said to him,
898860	900340	Accept my repentance.
901240	902920	Yehoshua took no notice of him.
903520	909540	One day Yehoshua was reciting the Shema, the central prayer in Judaism, one of them.
910620	913080	And Jesus came before him with the same request.
913740	919020	Yehoshua intended to accept his request and signaled him with his hand to wait until he completed his prayer.
919020	921320	It's against Jewish law to interrupt the Shema.
922080	923480	Because it's very important.
924060	927680	So Jesus approaches him while he's reciting and he says,
927780	928440	Hold on a second.
928980	931480	But Jesus didn't understand the signal and thought,
931620	932820	He's driving me away.
933600	937920	So he went and stood a brick upright to serve as an idol and bowed down to it.
938680	939960	Yehoshua then said to Jesus,
940140	940620	Repent!
941040	942020	And Jesus said to him,
942600	945320	This is the tradition that I received from you.
945320	950540	Whoever sins and causes the masses to sin is not given the opportunity to repent.
951660	952900	And the master says,
952980	956080	Jesus performed sorcery inside of the Jews to engage in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
958000	965460	Jews today use this story as an example of how not to treat people.
965460	970780	Often we will say that this was Jesus, Jesus.
971500	973300	Even if the facts don't quite line up.
973460	981500	And we'll say that Jesus went off and started his own religion because one of our rabbis was a jerk and wouldn't take his repentance.
982300	985580	And that's what Jesus says here when he says,
985580	988840	Yehoshua says repent, and Jesus says,
989240	993960	Look, I learned from you that even if I try to repent, you're not going to accept it.
994280	997200	So why should I even bother with you anymore?
997300	997760	You're a jerk.
999780	1002860	But is this the Jesus of the New Testament?
1003100	1003880	I don't know.
1003880	1008420	So, Evelyn, in this prayer that you just said,
1009260	1011200	they say, Lord.
1012100	1014120	Who is the Lord that they're talking about?
1014940	1019660	The word there in the Hebrew is the Tetragrammaton,
1019800	1020540	Yad-Heh-Vav-Heh.
1020760	1025740	This is the name that God gave to Moses at the burning bush to identify himself.
1025740	1035580	But we don't say that name, so we use a substitution, Adonai, and that's generally translated as Lord.
1036920	1045460	So, in the Jewish religion, we believe in God, but not Jesus, as our Savior.
1045760	1047320	That's pretty much what we're trying to answer.
1048380	1051120	We don't accept him as the Messiah,
1051120	1057920	but we're also not really sure if he was even a real historical guy
1057920	1062580	or if the Gospel accounts happened as they're written or, you know.
1065460	1068340	And why do we not accept Jesus?
1068500	1069860	What do we really think about him?
1071400	1075700	Well, to answer that, I will pose to you a question.
1077900	1081060	Who do you prefer, Rabbi Hillel or Rabbi Shammai?
1081120	1085620	Don't know the dude.
1086280	1087800	Yeah, you don't know the dude.
1088220	1090900	We don't really think about Jesus that much, honestly.
1091280	1097220	I think there's a sort of misconception that Jews just really are against Jesus,
1097580	1099620	but kind of just don't care.
1101340	1105220	I personally think that Jesus, as he's presented in the Gospels,
1105220	1108660	was a brilliant, radical reformer,
1108660	1112820	and that the Jews could probably listen to him here and there.
1114100	1119080	But the whole, like, Messiah, Son of God thing,
1119620	1123760	it's a little bit odd.
1124760	1126820	So Jews don't believe in the Holy Trinity.
1126980	1128880	Where does the Holy Spirit come in here?
1129260	1130080	The Holy Spirit.
1130080	1138840	I mean, everybody has the breath of God within them.
1140360	1143780	Are you going to, at some point,
1144020	1145980	because I don't want to get in the way of your narrative,
1146160	1148420	but are you going to talk about some of the differences,
1148580	1151980	like the differences in terms of belief in an eternal life,
1152120	1153660	or that sort of thing?
1153660	1155760	Was I going to?
1155940	1156780	Maybe, maybe not.
1157900	1159620	Write it down, add it to your list.
1159660	1161860	So it's Hillel and Shammai.
1162140	1163200	You don't know who they are?
1163440	1164180	Why do you care?
1166200	1166600	Yeah.
1167220	1168740	Hillel founded a society.
1169700	1170640	The Hillel Society.
1172200	1173760	I don't think he founded that.
1174240	1176440	He did invent the sandwich, allegedly.
1176440	1184040	I do want to address this question, though.
1184220	1187280	Differences in belief like the afterlife and such.
1188780	1190260	Afterlife is a tricky question,
1190420	1195260	because it's not directly addressed in the Tanakh,
1195520	1196300	the Hebrew scriptures.
1198140	1203260	So in the Tanakh,
1203260	1206540	the closest that we get to is a place called Sheol.
1207260	1208720	Translates to grave,
1209040	1211680	described as a dark, watery place underground.
1212620	1213600	So according to the Tanakh,
1213680	1215260	when you die, you get buried.
1216200	1217620	And that's about as far as we get.
1218920	1220080	After the Tanakh,
1220280	1223360	we have come up with various different theories.
1223620	1225800	One of them is the idea of the world to come.
1226340	1228640	This is pretty analogous to what Jesus would have called
1228640	1229640	the kingdom of God.
1230200	1231860	Some sort of utopian future
1231860	1235240	in which things will not suck.
1236680	1239940	And maybe some of us will come back to life.
1240060	1241120	Maybe some of us won't.
1241300	1243360	Some people believed in the resurrection.
1243560	1244300	Some didn't.
1245380	1248180	The Apostle Paul actually manages to escape
1248180	1249560	from persecution once
1249560	1251600	by bringing up bodily resurrection.
1251860	1253620	And then all the Jews start arguing with each other
1253620	1254680	and he kind of just slips away.
1257520	1260380	Some Jews today believe in reincarnation.
1260380	1264680	There's no real agreement.
1267080	1268540	Who were these people?
1269520	1273200	Hillel and Shammai were two very popular rabbis
1273200	1274080	back in the day.
1275860	1276520	What did it?
1277880	1279140	I don't know.
1279140	1283820	Nobody knows the mythical time of
1283820	1286220	when we tell stories about the sages.
1286880	1287960	No one knows.
1289040	1289820	But they, yes?
1290060	1291460	The question is,
1292600	1294540	the Gospels were written like,
1294940	1296240	say, a hundred years or so
1296240	1299640	after the death of Jesus.
1300020	1300280	Yes.
1300280	1303820	Now, when was this written and stuff?
1304200	1306400	I mean, is everything just open to interpretations
1306400	1309780	from who's ever writing whatever, you know?
1309860	1311440	The Talmud was probably written
1311440	1313480	about the same time as the Gospels.
1314440	1316740	So everything takes place
1316740	1318640	hundreds of years after the fact.
1318640	1320740	So it's just whatever the people,
1321680	1321920	you know,
1321960	1323880	oh, well, so-and-so said this or that.
1324200	1325700	And they don't actually know.
1325860	1326060	I mean.
1326300	1328400	Whatever message that they're trying to get across
1328400	1329920	is what they write down.
1329920	1330840	They didn't have cell phones to them.
1332140	1332900	And the internet.
1333760	1335380	And most people were not very literate,
1335440	1336760	so they couldn't have written things down.
1337020	1337180	Right.
1337180	1340420	We think that Paul was illiterate
1340420	1341920	and dictated all his letters.
1342820	1344460	Actually, I think we know that for sure
1344460	1347460	because he says in the preamble to the letters,
1348120	1348640	I'm Paul,
1348740	1350200	and this was written down by so-and-so.
1351600	1353140	But yeah, Hillel and Shammai
1353140	1354660	had two competing schools of thought,
1354860	1357000	and Hillel won pretty much every single argument.
1358120	1361200	And we only remember Shammai as a loser.
1364260	1366140	We've accepted that we can't know for sure
1366140	1367280	if Jesus was real or not.
1367800	1370440	Plenty of people are willing to just say,
1370700	1371460	yeah, he probably did.
1374620	1378800	What was Jesus's relationship with Jews?
1379680	1380580	So to understand that,
1380640	1381600	we're going to go through
1381600	1384360	what did Judaism look like in Jesus's day?
1384720	1387280	So Jesus was around during the second temple.
1387400	1388640	The first temple was destroyed
1388640	1390480	many long time ago.
1391360	1393660	And then the Jews came back to Israel
1393660	1395400	after some time away,
1395400	1396460	built a second temple.
1397120	1399780	And that's where Jesus is going all the time
1399780	1401500	whenever he goes to Jerusalem.
1402300	1404060	We have three main factions,
1404240	1406220	the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Zealots.
1406600	1408520	You might recognize some of these guys
1408520	1410020	from many of the Jesus stories.
1410860	1415060	So the Sadducees are the priestly class.
1415200	1416240	They run the temple.
1416500	1418420	They're in charge of the temple sacrifices.
1418420	1424860	They got into power because of a revolt earlier
1424860	1426720	when they kicked the Greeks out of the temple.
1427340	1429480	So they kind of have some political status.
1430020	1432240	And they work together with the Romans
1432240	1435720	because they have political status.
1435860	1439400	They want the Romans to not take that away from them.
1439400	1442660	They're very interested in maintaining the status quo.
1443840	1449300	The Pharisees are a faction that came out of the exile
1449300	1450980	in between the first and second temple.
1452000	1455740	So Judaism was pretty centered around the temple
1455740	1458520	until the exile when the temple was destroyed.
1458620	1460400	And they couldn't really do temple stuff anymore.
1460400	1461440	So they had to figure out,
1461940	1464100	how do we stay Jews in exile?
1464100	1468140	So they invented this form of portable Judaism
1468140	1471160	that was less focused on the temple rituals
1471160	1473760	and more focused on the Torah,
1474020	1476280	obeying the commands, personal piety.
1477360	1480400	This resulted in a decentralization of practice.
1480640	1485020	We didn't have to necessarily rely on the temple.
1486140	1488820	And they are a separatist faction
1488820	1491200	because they're so focused on the law,
1491200	1494120	they sort of isolate themselves.
1494360	1497360	They don't hang out with non-Pharisees very much.
1497700	1500700	They definitely will not eat at the same table as a Gentile
1500700	1503180	because who knows what Gentiles are eating.
1503300	1504420	It might not be kosher.
1504780	1508440	They might be praying to idols at that table, et cetera.
1509380	1514180	And then the Zealots are the anti-Roman guerrilla fighters.
1515680	1517880	They lived up in the Judean hill country
1517880	1521060	and would just get together and go attack some Romans.
1521200	1521920	Every now and then.
1523340	1524620	When would this have been?
1525080	1526660	This would have been around the time of Jesus,
1526820	1530320	probably around, I think we're talking 20 CE.
1533780	1536140	The second temple was destroyed in the year 70.
1536800	1540540	So around 0 to 70-ish CE.
1540540	1545720	Was there a connection between the Zealots and Masada?
1546820	1547020	Who?
1547500	1552420	Masada, the fortification that the Romans took.
1554420	1557680	I haven't read my Josephus enough, so I'm not...
1557680	1560020	When you talk about the second temple,
1560200	1563700	were those described as big temples in Jerusalem?
1563700	1564420	Is this one like the...
1564420	1565280	Yes.
1565920	1567280	Like the golden one?
1567280	1572120	So the first temple that I refer to is the Temple of Solomon.
1573800	1577220	It's the central location of Jewish worship
1577220	1579320	from the time of Solomon
1579320	1584300	throughout the whole Old Testament, basically.
1584300	1589060	Solomon is described to have built an enormous temple
1589060	1591220	with a lot of gold and a lot of stuff.
1591380	1594760	And then the Babylonians come in and knock that down.
1595520	1598640	And a while later, the Persians say,
1598940	1600840	you're allowed to go back and build a new one.
1601440	1603860	It's not quite as impressive as the first one.
1603980	1605860	And the people who remember the first one
1605860	1607660	start crying because it's so lame
1607660	1608900	compared to what they remember.
1608900	1615460	And then the Romans knocked that one down,
1615680	1616840	and now there's no temple.
1617540	1617940	Okay.
1619300	1621220	So it's the one temple.
1622060	1622440	Yes.
1623240	1623860	One temple.
1624120	1624360	Okay.
1626600	1627980	Unless you're a Samaritan
1627980	1629100	because they had a different temple,
1629320	1631820	but that's a whole other conversation.
1633760	1634860	Any other questions?
1635520	1638780	So this is way before they did the Golden Dome?
1639420	1639720	Temple?
1640720	1642500	Yeah, that's a Muslim temple.
1642820	1643960	The Al-Waksim Mosque.
1644180	1644440	Yeah.
1644840	1645380	My bad.
1645920	1648580	What was Jesus' relationship to all these guys?
1648940	1652360	We can probably guess that the Pharisees and Sadducees
1652360	1654700	weren't too fond of him if you've read your Gospels
1654700	1655940	because they're always trying to trick him
1655940	1657400	into saying silly things.
1658140	1660120	So let's start with some stories.
1661120	1662620	Then they came to Jerusalem,
1662620	1664980	and he, Jesus, entered the temple
1664980	1667180	and began to drive out those who were selling
1667180	1668980	and those who were buying in the temple,
1669560	1671620	and he overturned the tables of the money changers
1671620	1673340	and the seats of those who sold doves,
1673720	1674880	and he would not allow anyone
1674880	1676400	to carry anything through the temple.
1676980	1678100	He was teaching and saying,
1678280	1679040	Is it not written,
1679180	1680740	My house shall be called a house of prayer
1680740	1681880	for all the nations?
1681880	1684620	But you have made it a den of robbers.
1685220	1686940	And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it,
1687000	1689180	they kept looking for a way to kill him,
1689600	1690720	for they were afraid of him,
1690860	1693820	because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching.
1695340	1696600	It makes sense.
1696840	1697880	It does make sense.
1698060	1700460	We're probably talking about the Sadducees here
1700460	1701460	because it's the temple,
1701640	1703620	and the Sadducees control the temple cult.
1703620	1706300	And they are being,
1706740	1708740	Judy mentioned them earlier today,
1708960	1713160	saying that they're charging for money conversion.
1713400	1716780	They're charging for the sacrifices that you have to make.
1717140	1718080	They're not optional.
1718340	1719040	They are mandatory.
1720020	1721540	Everyone's skimming off the top.
1722140	1725000	And Jesus is not okay with the Sadducees
1725000	1729240	profiting off of mandatory religious ritual.
1729240	1734380	So he thinks that everyone should be able to participate
1734380	1736360	in temple sacrifice,
1736500	1738380	whether they can afford to or not.
1739100	1740440	So he comes in and says,
1740560	1741600	You guys are a bunch of jerks.
1741680	1742540	I'm flipping your tables.
1746700	1750260	So there's clearly bad blood between Jesus and the Sadducees.
1751520	1754940	Next we have Jesus and the Pharisees.
1755860	1758240	And as Jesus sat at dinner in the house,
1758240	1760380	many tax collectors and sinners came
1760380	1762200	and were sitting with Jesus and his disciples.
1762740	1764200	When the Pharisees saw this,
1764560	1765680	he said to his disciples,
1766220	1768880	Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?
1769480	1771180	But when he heard this, he said,
1771720	1774200	Those who are well have no need of a physician,
1774400	1775480	but those who are sick.
1776080	1777620	Go and learn what this means.
1778060	1780220	I desire mercy, not sacrifice.
1780920	1783500	For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.
1783500	1789280	So we talked earlier about how Pharisees won't eat with non-Pharisees
1789280	1793380	because they're worried about becoming ritually impure
1793380	1796320	or accidentally eating non-kosher food,
1796400	1798160	food that might have been sacrificed to idols.
1798960	1801440	So they see Jesus eating with these people,
1801640	1802820	tax collectors and sinners.
1802820	1807980	I always think it's funny that tax collectors are lumped in.
1811280	1815860	The historical reason for that is that tax collectors worked with and for the Romans,
1816100	1820420	and they usually would not take Jewish law very seriously.
1821000	1823020	They were pretty assimilated to Roman culture.
1823020	1826440	They were considered, like, traitors.
1827020	1829360	Okay, so the Pharisees are very focused on the law,
1829840	1830740	the book of the law.
1831380	1834760	But Jesus here is quoting from the prophets, like Isaiah,
1835740	1837840	in which God says,
1839400	1842340	Your sacrifices are meaningless to me.
1842640	1844660	Your festivals are repugnant.
1845860	1849860	The sacrifice that I want is for you to take care of the poor,
1849860	1850720	the widow, and the orphan.
1850720	1855500	Jesus took this message to heart and preached it quite regularly.
1856760	1861700	And so he's kind of calling the Pharisees out for being very hoity-toity,
1861880	1865960	but not actually doing anything useful that is actually helping anybody.
1870920	1873740	We've got quite a few of them people in our society now,
1873840	1875900	and Jesus needs to come and talk to them again.
1877200	1878380	That's an understatement.
1880720	1881760	Yeah.
1886560	1894120	And we have a story that deals a little bit with his relationship with the zealots.
1894120	1899500	Then they, meaning the authorities, the Jewish authorities,
1900160	1904680	sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said.
1904840	1906120	And they came and said to him,
1906580	1910480	Teacher, we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one,
1910600	1912840	for you do not regard people with partiality,
1912960	1915840	but teach the way of God in accordance with truth.
1916560	1919600	Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
1920100	1922360	Should we pay them or should we not?
1922360	1924800	But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them,
1925080	1926960	Why are you putting me to the test?
1927400	1929440	Bring me a denarius and let me see it.
1929840	1930680	And they brought one.
1931000	1931860	And he said to them,
1932280	1935160	Whose head is this and whose title?
1935760	1937160	They answered, Caesar's.
1937700	1938540	Jesus said to them,
1938660	1943160	Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.
1943460	1944960	They were utterly amazed at him.
1944960	1950040	So they're trying to catch him in a trap where if he says,
1950260	1952920	Yes, we should pay our taxes, then he's a Roman shill.
1953780	1957100	And if he says, No, we should not pay our taxes,
1957760	1960640	then they can get him in trouble with the Roman government.
1960860	1964740	So either way, he's between a rock and a hard place.
1964740	1968540	But he pulls this maneuver where he says,
1969080	1971080	Look, it's George Washington's face on the quarter.
1972440	1974620	God doesn't care about this.
1975700	1977100	The money is already his.
1977180	1978140	Just give it back to him.
1979340	1985920	So he's clearly rejecting the sort of militaristic, anti-Roman position of the Zealots.
1987320	1988920	What are the Herodians?
1988920	1993240	Herodians, they're the faction of King Herod,
1993860	1999360	who was put into power after the Maccabean Revolt,
2000000	2003060	which was the same revolt that put the Sadducees in power.
2003760	2008540	So he's pretty much referring to the Sadducees in a roundabout way.
2011660	2013260	So people higher up.
2013780	2014100	Yes.
2014820	2017040	So Jesus had strong words for everybody.
2017040	2019380	He was very radical,
2019580	2023220	very interested in reforming the Jewish community into something better.
2023660	2026540	Are the Jews responsible for killing Jesus?
2029160	2035140	This has been a thing that Jews have had to deal with for the last 2,000 years,
2036040	2037920	being called the Christ killers.
2037920	2042480	According to this book,
2044180	2046260	Jesus was executed by a crucifixion,
2046340	2049300	which was a common method of torture and execution used by the Romans.
2050020	2052340	So the execution of Jesus was a Roman affair,
2052760	2055600	possibly with the cooperation of Jewish leadership in Jerusalem.
2056180	2060860	The Romans did not need to try a troublesome Jewish peasant in order to kill him.
2060860	2066760	They tortured and crucified nameless lower class people all the time in order to get rid of Jesus,
2066860	2068240	who had caused a disturbance in the temple,
2068680	2071760	had made radical sounding pronouncements and prophecies,
2071880	2074280	and was rumored to have aspirations to kingship.
2074800	2078100	The Romans would have simply taken him by force and crucified him the next day,
2078200	2080500	along with a few others they were getting rid of.
2080720	2082200	There was no need for any trial,
2082360	2084840	much less two or more before different courts
2084840	2088980	would have been more trouble than a Roman government needed for the desired result.
2088980	2094380	So the gospel narratives are a little bit confusing
2094380	2097580	in the context of the actual political reality of the time.
2098060	2103200	It seems like all the rigmarole was completely unnecessary.
2104140	2107100	But I like to take literature seriously anyways.
2107960	2111500	So if we read the gospel accounts and what they say,
2112560	2117280	we can just say that they happen pretty much
2117280	2119280	the way that they're written down
2119280	2122000	and still get some information out of them.
2122840	2127840	There's a few threads common to all of the gospel accounts.
2128100	2130820	Some differences, but there are some commonalities.
2132040	2136500	First one is that in all of the accounts,
2137060	2144400	Jesus is captured by the Romans in collaboration with the Sadducees
2144400	2148840	because he is a threat to their power
2148840	2153260	and the institutions, political institutions that they're a part of.
2154260	2157640	He is directly flipping over their tables and such
2157640	2163220	and calling for reform, trying to take away their sources of revenue.
2164300	2166380	Does anyone know who Barabbas is?
2166380	2169380	It was the alternative.
2170200	2170640	Yes.
2172480	2173000	Yes.
2173380	2173680	Yes.
2175300	2179020	In the gospel accounts, when Jesus is brought before Pilate,
2179100	2180080	the governor of Judea,
2180380	2186640	apparently there is a tradition around Passover
2186640	2189220	when the governor would pardon one criminal,
2189840	2191300	whoever the Jews chose.
2191300	2193240	This is an outrageous tradition.
2193360	2194340	There's no way this happened.
2194440	2196460	It's kind of like Prima Nocta and Braveheart,
2196560	2197240	if you've seen that.
2199360	2201280	It's very good storytelling,
2201480	2202840	but it probably didn't happen.
2204000	2206380	So there's Jesus and there's Barabbas,
2206760	2208180	who is the other criminal.
2208340	2211740	He's described as a murderer and a seditionist.
2211740	2215820	And the Jews say,
2216040	2216940	we want Barabbas.
2217440	2218240	Free that guy.
2219360	2221400	Barabbas is not a real name.
2221780	2222660	It's Aramaic.
2222880	2226200	Bar-Abbas, son of the father,
2226500	2229780	which is completely meaningless.
2230000	2233000	It basically just means a person.
2233000	2240020	We can contrast that with the name that Jesus used for himself,
2240260	2240900	son of man,
2241080	2242780	which is completely meaningless
2242780	2245480	and basically just means a person.
2246380	2249300	So the gospel narratives are creating this dichotomy
2249300	2251420	between Jesus and Barabbas,
2252100	2255180	who are their names are meant to be similar,
2255900	2257300	to call our attention to them.
2257300	2261540	Jesus is this peace-loving pacifist.
2261940	2264240	He is submitting himself to execution.
2265420	2266900	The gospel of John says,
2267320	2268960	I could free myself if I wanted.
2269080	2272480	I could have my followers storm this place and free me,
2272620	2273900	but I'm not going to do that
2273900	2279360	because my kingdom is a kingdom of peace.
2279440	2282360	It's a kingdom of the last coming first,
2282360	2284640	the mighty being brought low.
2284640	2289020	Meanwhile, Barabbas is an insurrectionist and a murderer.
2289260	2291100	He's one of the zealots probably
2291100	2295180	going around trying to gain Jewish independence
2295180	2296840	from Rome by violent means.
2297480	2302060	So the story is saying the Jews chose violence
2302060	2307160	rather than the way of peace that Jesus was teaching.
2309800	2312260	And I think that's probably the message
2312260	2315640	that the Jews of the first century would have heard.
2317540	2320760	So, yeah.
2322700	2326780	We also know that Jesus was a victim
2326780	2328840	of sort of a mob mentality
2328840	2330520	in all of the gospel accounts.
2331400	2333420	It's the Sadducees who start up
2333420	2335140	the crucified Jesus chants
2335140	2337160	and everybody kind of just goes along.
2338000	2338920	I don't know if anyone here
2338920	2340320	has seen the movie Borat.
2342160	2343300	But if you have,
2343380	2345060	you've seen Sacha Baron Cohen
2345060	2346320	pretending to be a foreigner
2346320	2348140	going up and saying things like,
2348520	2350160	we support your war of terror.
2350880	2354460	We support killing every single man,
2354580	2356460	woman, and child in Iraq.
2356660	2358760	And all the people start cheering
2358760	2359840	and going along with it.
2359900	2361760	So it's pretty easy to get a mob
2361760	2362860	to agree with almost anything.
2362860	2365580	And again,
2365880	2367940	Roman execution,
2369040	2372780	the historicity of whether or not
2372780	2373780	the Jews were allowed
2373780	2375060	to administer capital punishment
2375060	2376220	is in question.
2376460	2378260	But according to the gospel narratives,
2378360	2378820	they couldn't,
2378880	2380160	and that's why they had to bring him
2380160	2381700	to the Romans.
2382400	2384060	But pretty clearly,
2386280	2386640	okay,
2387060	2389280	so how is Judaism different from Christianity?
2390280	2392360	Jews are more focused on action than belief.
2392860	2398220	nobody cares really
2398220	2399860	if a Jew believes in God or not.
2400200	2402200	There are a ton of atheist Jews
2402200	2404580	who are still Jewish
2404580	2406500	and still very accepted as Jews.
2407060	2408600	What we care about is
2408600	2411760	being a good person,
2412600	2414380	obeying the laws maybe.
2415340	2417580	Depending on what that means to you,
2417700	2419520	there are a lot of different positions.
2419520	2423380	I think for Christians,
2423540	2424800	mostly there is a lot more
2424800	2426880	emphasis on belief.
2427260	2429740	You are expected to believe in Jesus,
2430000	2432320	believe in the resurrection.
2434680	2435840	There's a bunch of creeds
2435840	2436760	like the Apostles' Creed,
2436880	2437560	the Nicene Creed.
2437720	2438660	You might know of those.
2440460	2442020	Many, many Christians
2442020	2443060	were burned at the stake
2443060	2444200	by Christian authorities
2444200	2446360	for having
2446360	2448120	some heretical beliefs.
2449560	2450500	Judy would have been
2450500	2451240	burned at the stake
2451240	2452540	if she was a believer.
2453540	2454980	I wouldn't have laughed so long.
2456500	2457180	That's great.
2457740	2459460	Christianity is generally considered
2459460	2461020	to be a pretty individual affair.
2461180	2462280	It's between you and Jesus.
2462280	2467740	Judaism is a group activity.
2468140	2470040	You cannot be Jewish by yourself.
2471380	2472120	Say what?
2472580	2474800	You cannot be Jewish by yourself.
2475700	2476820	It's cultural.
2477440	2480520	Jews cannot pray alone
2480520	2482420	most of the prayers.
2484000	2485480	There's so many people alone.
2485480	2487180	You're required to pray in dominion,
2487620	2489780	which is often translated as a quorum,
2489780	2492200	which is traditionally a group
2492200	2494220	of ten adult Jewish men.
2495100	2497060	Today, we will usually let women
2497060	2498080	be part of the dominion.
2499560	2500280	Thanks.
2503560	2505260	You're not allowed to do
2505260	2507740	morning practices by yourself.
2507960	2511000	If your mom or dad dies,
2511160	2513300	you have to pray the morning prayers
2513300	2514140	in a dominion.
2514800	2517100	You're not allowed to practice that
2517100	2518260	in isolation.
2519780	2521260	So, you have to go to the temple?
2522260	2522660	Yes.
2522980	2523100	Yeah.
2523220	2523580	Currently.
2524400	2524780	Currently.
2525300	2527540	We don't have a temple temple anymore.
2527840	2528900	So, you'd have to find
2528900	2530360	like your local synagogue,
2531120	2533980	which sometimes we will call a temple.
2534640	2537400	A better translation would be
2537400	2538980	a house of prayer.
2541180	2542440	So, yeah.
2543520	2545220	You can pray at homes
2545220	2547000	or does it have to be at the synagogue?
2547000	2548960	It can be anywhere
2548960	2550480	as long as you have a minion.
2551840	2552880	Of mostly men.
2554640	2556320	Depends on how orthodox you are.
2556720	2557900	Well, that's my question.
2558400	2559880	So, when you say more focused
2559880	2561040	on action than belief,
2561760	2564580	what would an orthodox rabbi say?
2564720	2566300	Think of that bullet point.
2566520	2567360	Would they agree with you?
2568540	2569840	An orthodox is stricter?
2570280	2572280	Just so I know what you're...
2572280	2574040	I just want to clarify.
2574760	2575500	Versus reform.
2576400	2576800	Right.
2576880	2578820	There's three major branches of Judaism
2578820	2581040	today in America.
2581260	2582400	We have the modern orthodox,
2582520	2583060	the conservative,
2583260	2583980	and the reform.
2584500	2586240	I won't get too much into the history,
2586780	2588040	but they all have
2588040	2589640	different positions
2589640	2590800	about the Jewish law,
2590900	2592240	and that's the key differentiation.
2592240	2595760	So, is Jewish law binding?
2595980	2596740	Are we required
2596740	2597940	to follow Jewish law?
2598380	2600040	And, can Jewish law
2600040	2600800	change over time?
2601060	2602000	Are we allowed
2602000	2605140	to reinterpret
2605140	2606540	the law
2606540	2608320	in response
2608320	2609340	to our changing times?
2610020	2611360	So, the modern orthodox
2611360	2612220	basically say,
2612600	2613740	yes, Jewish law is binding,
2614340	2615840	and no, it does not change.
2616280	2617220	So, they are very
2617220	2619100	conservative,
2619540	2621180	very much sticks in the mud.
2622240	2623820	The conservative movement
2623820	2624940	is kind of a middle ground.
2625340	2626620	Yes, the law is binding.
2626740	2627760	You have to follow the law,
2627960	2629660	but we can change it
2629660	2630740	in response to
2630740	2633960	our evolving understanding
2633960	2634620	of humanity
2634620	2636220	and society.
2637040	2637640	Reform
2637640	2638680	are
2638680	2640160	very loosey-goosey.
2641380	2643080	The law is not binding.
2643240	2644420	It's more of a suggestion,
2644860	2646780	and it's subject to change.
2646880	2647900	We can adapt it.
2647900	2653120	So, the modern orthodox
2653120	2654980	would still agree
2654980	2656280	that action is much more
2656280	2657180	important than belief.
2659820	2662180	But they might think
2662180	2663460	that a lot of the,
2663940	2664440	for example,
2664560	2665180	atheist Jews
2665180	2666900	are crazy.
2666900	2670140	So, that would be
2670140	2671500	under the last cow.
2673220	2673880	The crazies?
2674120	2674980	The crazy people.
2675580	2676180	You're just saying
2676180	2676580	reform.
2677560	2677760	Yeah.
2677760	2678940	They'd probably be
2678940	2680040	considered more reform,
2680200	2681020	but I, yeah.
2681360	2681680	Yes?
2682380	2683540	Well, I'm focusing
2683540	2684400	on the word action.
2685000	2685960	So, when you say
2685960	2686760	an orthodox
2686760	2688100	would still believe
2688100	2688580	that action
2688580	2689380	is more important
2689380	2689760	than belief,
2689880	2690100	what's,
2690200	2691540	is that action like,
2692360	2693200	like following
2693200	2693900	the rituals?
2693900	2694600	rituals?
2695200	2695420	Yeah.
2695540	2696240	For the orthodox,
2696320	2697680	it would primarily be
2697680	2700500	doing the three daily prayers,
2701240	2702220	keeping kosher,
2703240	2705420	making sure
2705420	2706060	that you
2706060	2707680	don't touch
2707680	2708440	dead bodies
2708440	2709120	or lizards
2709120	2710100	or whatever.
2712580	2714340	But not on good works.
2715800	2716980	Not so much
2716980	2717860	for the orthodox,
2718660	2719400	but the further
2719400	2719840	you get
2719840	2720400	to the right
2720400	2721100	of this chart,
2721100	2722860	the less
2722860	2723900	that they're worried
2723900	2724860	about the sort
2724860	2725500	of traditional
2725500	2727280	laws
2727280	2727800	and the more
2727800	2728400	that they're worried
2728400	2729380	about the more
2729380	2730360	social justice
2730360	2731120	part of it,
2731380	2732340	the prophetic,
2732880	2734160	I don't care
2734160	2735120	about your fasts,
2735160	2735860	help the poor.
2737800	2738360	Clothing,
2738560	2739020	clothing
2739020	2740600	and hair.
2741520	2741720	Yeah,
2741760	2742780	that's more on this side,
2742940	2744600	the clothing requirements.
2745520	2746960	This just is reminding me
2746960	2748160	of Christianity today
2748160	2749880	with the extreme
2749880	2751820	conservative fundamentalists
2751820	2753000	who would have
2753000	2754240	stormed out of here
2754240	2754900	when you said
2754900	2755760	anything at all
2755760	2756340	about whether
2756340	2757380	Jesus existed
2757380	2758160	or not
2758160	2760900	because the Bible
2760900	2762600	is inerrant,
2762780	2763320	infallible
2763320	2765000	and has no
2765000	2766020	contradictions in it.
2766120	2766260	I mean,
2766300	2767300	that's their position
2767300	2768040	and so the law
2768040	2768640	is everything
2768640	2770060	and your belief
2770060	2770500	is everything.
2770600	2771400	But on the other side,
2771500	2771800	it would be like
2771800	2773160	the UCC for sure
2773160	2774360	and the Presbyterians
2774360	2775620	to a degree
2775620	2777060	that we're going
2777060	2778160	to put social justice
2778160	2779640	and human needs first.
2780380	2781520	So would you say
2781520	2782880	we're more reform?
2783320	2783480	Sure.
2784000	2784600	As Christians,
2785000	2785320	oh yeah,
2785400	2786140	because the folks
2786140	2787060	on the left,
2787380	2788740	on this chart that is,
2789240	2789980	don't even think
2789980	2791040	that progressive Christians
2791040	2792080	are Christians at all.
2792360	2793320	They think we're going to hell
2793320	2795160	because we don't believe
2795160	2796100	the way they believe.
2796740	2797480	They're very rigid
2797480	2798840	and that's who's
2798840	2799760	in power right now.
2800000	2801160	That mindset
2801160	2803140	is the powerful mindset
2803140	2804340	in our country.
2804340	2805040	In fact,
2805100	2805920	the modern orthodox
2805920	2807260	wouldn't even consider me Jewish
2807260	2807900	because I had
2807900	2809240	conservative conversion
2809240	2810980	and that is not
2810980	2811960	strict enough for them.
2812200	2812400	Bless you.
2813260	2814080	So are there different
2814080	2814920	synagogues
2814920	2815900	with these different,
2816340	2817340	you can be a
2817340	2818500	conservative
2818500	2820500	synagogue
2820500	2822200	or you can be a reform.
2822680	2823760	For the most part,
2824120	2827240	a Jew is a Jew
2827240	2828540	and you can go
2828540	2829920	to wherever you want.
2829920	2830820	This is
2830820	2834020	more at
2834020	2835880	like an institutional level
2835880	2836660	of,
2838660	2839500	you know,
2839560	2840280	there's like a bunch
2840280	2840840	of rabbis
2840840	2841740	in a building somewhere
2841740	2843180	making rules
2843180	2844160	and publishing books
2844160	2844680	and stuff
2844680	2846660	but most everyday Jews
2846660	2847740	just don't really care
2847740	2848220	that much
2848220	2848840	and will go to
2848840	2849560	whatever synagogue
2849560	2850300	is closest.
2851880	2853280	So if you
2853280	2854220	walk
2854220	2855780	to synagogue,
2855780	2857880	does that mean
2857880	2859040	you're at least
2859040	2859700	a conservative?
2861000	2862640	Would the reformed Jews
2862640	2863560	consider that
2863560	2864320	this idea
2864320	2865600	of not doing
2865600	2866420	work,
2866840	2867660	not starting
2867660	2868400	your car,
2869540	2870720	would they go
2870720	2871100	for that
2871100	2871540	or is that
2871540	2872440	a conservative Jew?
2872440	2878360	The car issue
2878360	2878900	is not really
2878900	2879600	a work issue.
2879800	2880140	It's about
2880140	2880960	kindling fire
2880960	2881460	on the Sabbath
2881460	2883520	or carrying
2883520	2884120	on the Sabbath
2884120	2885160	which are two
2885160	2886320	other prohibitions
2886320	2887340	that you're not
2887340	2887740	allowed to do
2887740	2888120	those things
2888120	2888580	on the Sabbath.
2891180	2892020	Modern Orthodox,
2892340	2892940	you definitely
2892940	2893560	are not allowed
2893560	2894180	to drive a car.
2895880	2896760	The leaders
2896760	2897460	of the conservative
2897460	2897940	movement
2897940	2900020	made a ruling
2900020	2901000	some years ago
2901000	2901920	that
2901920	2903280	it's better
2903280	2903760	for you
2903760	2904380	to go
2904380	2905020	to synagogue
2905020	2906040	than not.
2906600	2907200	So if you
2907200	2908120	must drive
2908120	2908940	to get to
2908940	2909200	synagogue
2909200	2910180	then you can
2910180	2911960	but you probably
2911960	2912380	shouldn't be
2912380	2913240	driving anywhere else.
2913920	2914360	That kind of
2914360	2914720	sounds like
2914720	2915720	an Amish people.
2917380	2918160	So with not
2918160	2919040	using the power,
2920060	2920980	the energy
2920980	2921620	that is only
2921620	2922080	on Sabbath.
2923640	2924860	Electric cars
2924860	2925780	are fine.
2926540	2926920	Really?
2930500	2931100	Because
2931100	2932460	it's kindling
2932460	2933460	fire that
2933460	2934020	is prohibited.
2934200	2934720	So the spark
2934720	2935100	flag
2935100	2936000	or the...
2936000	2936200	Yeah,
2936500	2937480	internal combustion
2937480	2938120	engines are all...
2938120	2938920	But without using
2938920	2940000	lights in the house,
2940140	2941280	isn't that considered
2941280	2943560	by the Orthodox...
2943560	2944240	Modern Orthodox,
2944740	2946100	for some reason,
2946560	2947140	have decided
2947140	2947980	that electricity
2947980	2948640	is fire.
2949600	2949960	Yes.
2950380	2951180	Nobody else
2951180	2951540	agrees.
2951980	2952280	Okay.
2953440	2954080	Weird.
2954580	2954780	Yeah.
2955440	2955620	Yeah.
2957980	2958980	So you can go back
2958980	2959800	to what you were saying.
2960340	2960700	I don't know
2960700	2961300	what I was saying.
2961440	2962020	What was I saying?
2965360	2965800	Alright,
2965920	2966600	so traditionally
2966600	2968160	Judaism is transmitted
2968160	2970000	by the mother.
2970340	2971040	So if your mom
2971040	2971540	is Jewish
2971540	2972000	then you're
2972000	2973060	automatically Jewish.
2973840	2974720	Different positions
2974720	2975400	on this now.
2975520	2976060	Most people
2976060	2976640	will say that
2976640	2977260	if either of your
2977260	2978620	parents was Jewish
2978620	2980120	and you were
2980120	2981720	exposed to Judaism
2981720	2982500	growing up
2982500	2983580	then you count.
2985500	2986360	Converting to...
2986360	2986640	Yes.
2986840	2987800	Can I ask a question?
2988020	2988280	Yes.
2989220	2989540	Okay,
2989640	2990760	so my grandfather
2990760	2991820	was Jewish
2991820	2992960	and my grandmother
2992960	2993880	wasn't.
2994120	2994420	Mm-hmm.
2995800	2997480	Does that affect
2997480	2999000	my grandfather's
2999000	2999680	Judaism
2999680	3000420	or...
3003220	3004440	Is the question
3004440	3005100	does marrying
3005100	3005600	a non-Jew
3005600	3006480	make him less Jewish?
3007900	3008540	Does he...
3008540	3010140	He stays Jewish,
3010180	3010520	right?
3010800	3011060	Yes.
3011240	3011580	Okay.
3012360	3012580	You know,
3012620	3013200	you can't stop
3013200	3013740	being Jewish.
3014640	3015160	Okay.
3015460	3016120	You couldn't
3016120	3016860	convert to another
3016860	3017240	religion?
3018320	3018960	I could,
3019080	3019500	but I wouldn't
3019500	3020320	stop being a Jew.
3020640	3021660	I would just be
3021660	3023000	an apostate.
3023380	3024220	A non-Jew
3024220	3025420	not a person
3025420	3027020	or an apostate?
3027300	3028040	Is that a Christian
3028040	3029960	or Christian Jews
3029960	3030980	or some Christian Jews?
3031660	3032180	Yeah,
3032320	3032740	there are.
3033040	3033260	Yeah.
3033600	3033820	Yeah.
3035100	3036280	There are a lot
3036280	3037060	of Buddhist Jews.
3038060	3039220	A whole lot
3039220	3040020	of Buddhist Jews.
3040860	3041380	We call them
3041380	3041900	Jubus.
3042500	3042780	Oh!
3042780	3042940	Oh!
3044940	3047280	But don't repeat
3047280	3047580	that.
3049100	3050080	That's our word.
3052120	3052680	So,
3052840	3054420	converting to Judaism
3054420	3056360	is quite different
3056360	3057180	than Christianity.
3058660	3059220	Especially,
3059560	3060220	for some reason,
3060360	3060520	like,
3060560	3061660	the more conservative
3061660	3062220	Christian,
3062400	3063200	the easier it is
3063200	3064520	to become Christian.
3064520	3064860	like,
3064900	3065480	you just pray
3065480	3066860	the prayer,
3067120	3067300	like,
3067360	3068040	I accept Jesus
3068040	3068720	into my heart
3068720	3069060	and boom,
3069120	3069640	you're Christian.
3072080	3073000	For Judaism,
3074100	3075540	if anybody remembers
3075540	3076040	the,
3076440	3076920	what is it called,
3077020	3077960	confirmation classes,
3078440	3079220	that kind of stuff,
3079480	3080300	it's sort of like that.
3080440	3082460	We generally have to spend
3082460	3083580	at least a year
3083580	3084760	studying Judaism,
3085000	3085760	learning all the
3085760	3087500	laws and the
3087500	3088020	traditions
3088020	3088780	and the practices
3088780	3089760	and the customs
3089760	3092080	and the history.
3092600	3093380	So it's more like
3093380	3094460	trying to get
3094460	3095000	citizenship
3095000	3096280	in a new country
3096280	3098480	where you have to
3098480	3099180	live in the country
3099180	3099780	for a while
3099780	3100340	and then you have
3100340	3101140	to take an exam.
3101800	3102600	When I converted,
3102740	3103420	I had to sit
3103420	3105160	in front of a
3105160	3106420	Jewish court
3106420	3107660	of three rabbis
3107660	3109240	and they asked me
3109240	3109740	questions
3109740	3110540	and I had to
3110540	3112000	prove that I knew
3112000	3113040	what I was talking about
3113040	3114240	and I'm sincere.
3114240	3116680	before I was alive.
3117120	3117280	Yeah.
3117860	3118900	Oh, there was a lot
3118900	3119300	of pressure.
3120140	3121560	I dabbed like an idiot.
3122340	3123460	Without being a smart
3123460	3123960	aleck, right?
3125480	3126840	I was still a smart aleck.
3127940	3129240	Do you read Hebrew?
3129600	3130520	Is that a requirement?
3131420	3132040	Reading Hebrew
3132040	3132620	is a requirement
3132620	3133500	for the modern Orthodox.
3135660	3138000	I cannot read Hebrew.
3138560	3139460	I can sort of
3139460	3140080	sound things out
3140080	3140540	a little bit
3140540	3141360	but a lot of the letters
3141360	3141900	look the same
3141900	3142380	and the vowels
3142380	3143000	are really hard
3143000	3143580	to figure out.
3143580	3145240	But that's the end
3145240	3145820	of my slides.
3146240	3146800	Okay, there.
3146960	3147480	That was perfect.
3148020	3149060	That's very nice.
3149340	3149760	Very good.
3149900	3150940	Thank you.
3151080	3151280	Yeah.
3151500	3152200	That was interesting.
3153560	3154420	I missed a lot of it.
3155500	3156040	Thank you.
3156040	3156440	Yay.
3157920	3158920	Thank you.
3158920	3159000	Thank you.
