<h1>A Tale of Two Sonics</h1><p><img src="icecream.gif" alt="A gif of a kid&rsquo;s ice cream flying sideways off the cone for no reason."></p>
<p>When I saw the first Sonic movie, it was out of morbid curiosity. Surely there was no way the studio could have salvaged what was sure to be a trainwreck, another cash-grab live action film preying on nostalgia with no meaningful substance to speak of.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong.</p>
<p>The first movie wasn&rsquo;t perfect. It had a few too many dated jokes and Fortnite dances. It was a little generic. But it wasn&rsquo;t remotely <em>bad</em>. It was, in fact, a somewhat touching tale about a blue alien finding a family in a faraway land, and learning to stop running (lol) and stand up to protect what was important to him. Classic shonen manga stuff.</p>
<p>Sonic 2 built on this and reached new heights. While still not perfect, with some minor pacing issues, it reached new levels of emotional resonance and cinematic fight scene special effects glory.</p>
<p>Sonic 3 was a string of bad, loosely-connected jokes and fanservice bone-throws.</p>
