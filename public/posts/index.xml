<h2 id="early-israelite-judean-presence-in-the-levant">Early Israelite-Judean Presence in the Levant</h2>
<h3 id="merneptah">Merneptah</h3>
<p>The earliest extrabiblical textual evidence of a people group called Israel is the Merneptah Stele, unearthed in Thebes, Egypt, and dated to c. 1208 BCE. The last section of text on the stele celebrates Merneptah&rsquo;s military victories in Canaan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The princes are prostrate, saying &lsquo;Peace!&rsquo;<br>
Not one raises his head among the Nine Bows.<br>
Desolation is for Tjehenu;<br>
Hatti is pacified;<br>
Plundered is the Canaan with every evil;<br>
Carried off is Asqaluni;<br>
Seized upon is Gezer;<br>
Yanoam is made non-existent;<br>
Israel is laid waste—its seed is no more;<br>
Kharru has become a widow because of Egypt.<br>
All lands together are pacified.<br>
Everyone who was restless has been bound. (Chavalas et al.)</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="conquest">Conquest</h3>
<p>Joshua 2-12 recounts the Israelites&rsquo; invasion of Canaan and the complete annihilation of the Canaanites. This story is directly contradicted in later sections of Joshua, as well as in Judges and 2 Samuel. The invasion is also not supported archeologically: excavations of several cities named in Josh 2-12 show &ldquo;no evidence of <em>extensive</em> conquest in thirteenth- and twelfth-century B.C.E. layers&rdquo; (Hayes, 192). Jericho had been abandoned for two centuries at the time of the alleged conquest, so Joshua certainly did not miraculously take the city through magical circumambulations.</p>
<h3 id="immigration">Immigration</h3>
<p>The next few sections draw heavily from Gottwald.</p>
<p>One theory of Israelites&rsquo; entry into Canaan is that they immigrated into un- or sparsely-populated regions of the hill country, avoiding fortified Canaanite cities, and slowly came to take over the whole territory. There was, indeed, a great deal of political upheaval at the time. The Mycenaean civilization, Trojan Wars, and Hittite invasion of Anatolia, coupled with Egypt&rsquo;s weakening grip on the region, resulted in significant migration into the Levant, especially from the Mediterranean (the &ldquo;Sea People&rdquo; who would become the Philistines were presumably Mediterranean refugees).</p>
<p>This theory posits that Israel migrated into the Levant during this period from the east at the same time the Pelas moved in from the west via the Mediterranean. However, the archeological evidence does not support a theory of extensive Israelite migration into the Levant in the thirteenth century. Excavations of many sites listed in the biblical text do show new settlement, but these settlements&rsquo; material culture is identical to that of other Canaanite settlements, with the exception of a startling lack of pig bones. This seems to suggest that these settlements were rather established by groups of Canaanites who had recently adopted a religious prohibition of consuming pork.</p>
<h3 id="revolution">Revolution</h3>
<p>Another theory is one of social revolution, and draws on textual evidence from the Amarna letters, government correspondence between Egypt and Canaan. In short, the letters describe a troublemaking group of social outcasts called the Habiru, who had a reputation as raiders, outlaws, and slaves. This theory posits that some Habirus escaped Egypt, settled in Canaan, and introduced the worship of their liberator god into the region. While this theory is attractive because of its consistency with the archeological continuity discussed above and its explanation of the origin of the Exodus story, the linguistic connection between &ldquo;Habiru&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hebrew&rdquo; is tenuous at best, and there is, as far as I can see, no material evidence to support it.</p>
<h3 id="gradual-emergence">Gradual Emergence</h3>
<p>The final theory of Israelite migration into the Levant is actually not one of migration at all. Rather, this theory posits that some Canaanites just decided to take up a new religion and started new settlements. These groups united into a loose confederation predicated on shared religious practice and eventually became Israel.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can establish that, by the thirteenth century BCE, there was most likely a loose confederation of tribes or people groups, at least some of whom were known by the name Israel, who were united by a mono- or henotheistic worship of &rsquo;&rsquo; living in the Levant.</p>
<h3 id="monarchy">Monarchy</h3>
<p>There is some evidence that there was a historical Kingdom of Israel. The Tel Dan Stele and Mesha Stele both refer to the &ldquo;House of David&rdquo;. Unlike the thirteenth century, there is ample evidence that <em>somebody</em> was developing an urban society in the Levant in the tenth century. Naturally, each archeological find is hotly debated, but the scholarly consensus seems to be that there probably was an Israelite kingdom or proto-kingdom, but that it was almost certainly not so large nor so unified as the biblical story claims.</p>
<h3 id="the-babylonian-exile">The Babylonian Exile</h3>
<p>Of course, to establish the historicity of the Edict of Cyrus, we must first establish the historicity of the Babylonian Exile.</p>
<p>The Babylonian Chronicles corroborate a military campaign against Israel in 597:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the seventh year, in the month of Kislev, the king of Akkad mustered his troops, marched to the Hatti-land, and encamped against the City of Judah and on the ninth day of the month of Adar he seized the city and captured the king. He appointed there a king of his own choice and taking heavy tribute brought it back to Babylon. (Finḳelshṭayn)</p></blockquote>
<p>Archeological evidence supports the near-total destruction of Jerusalem in 587 and the deportation of at least 20,000 Judeans (also Finḳelshṭayn).</p>
<h2 id="the-edict-of-cyrus">The Edict of Cyrus</h2>
<p>All that to say that the Edict of Cyrus was almost certainly a real event; whether it applied to the Judeans is, however, up for debate.</p>
<h3 id="the-cyrus-cylinder">The Cyrus Cylinder</h3>
<p>This baby is about as definitive as it gets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I entered Babylon as a friend and (when) I established the seat of the government in the palace of the ruler under jubilation and rejoicing, Marduk, the great lord, [induced] the magnanimous inhabitants of Babylon [to love me], and I was daily endeavouring to worship him. My numerous troops walked around in Babylon in peace, I did not allow anybody to terrorize (any place) of the [country of Sumer] and Akkad. I strove for peace in Babylon and in all his (other) sacred cities. As to the inhabitants of Babylon, [who] against the will of the gods [had/were&hellip;, I abolished] the corvée (lit.: yoke) which was against their (social) standing. I brought relief to their dilapidated housing, putting (thus) an end to their (main) complaints. Marduk, the great lord, was well pleased with my deeds and sent friendly blessings to myself, Cyrus, the king who worships him, to Cambyses, my son, the offspring of [my] loins, as well as to all my troops, and we all [praised] his great [godhead] joyously, standing before him in peace.</p>
<p>All the kings of the entire world from the Upper to the Lower Sea, those who are seated in throne rooms, (those who) live in other [types of buildings as well as] all the kings of the West land living in tents, brought their heavy tributes and kissed my feet in Babylon. (As to the region) from&hellip; as far as Ashur and Susa, Agade, Eshnunna, the towns Zamban, Me-Turnu, Der as well as the region of the Gutians, I returned to (these) sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to ‘live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations. Furthermore, I resettled upon the command of Marduk, the great lord, all the gods of Sumer and Akkad whom Nabonidus has brought into Babylon to the anger of the lord of the gods, unharmed, in their (former) chapels, the places which make them happy.</p>
<p>May all the gods whom I have resettled in their sacred cities ask daily Bel and Nebo for a long life for me and may they recommend me (to him); to Marduk, my lord, they may say this: “Cyrus, the king who worships you, and Cambyses, his son, &hellip; all of them I settled in a peaceful place&hellip; ducks and doves, &hellip; I endeavoured to fortify/repair their dwelling places&hellip; (Pritchard)</p></blockquote>
<p>Kuhrt points out two pieces of evidence that further flesh out the story of Cyrus, one a chronicle covering the reign of Nabonidus of Babylon, and one a poem condemning Nabonidus and praising Cyrus. Kuhrt accepts the Cylinder&rsquo;s authenticity but questions the motives of the Cylinder and poem, which she sees as propaganda pieces to support Cyrus&rsquo;s rule. Her translation of a fragment of the chronicle supports her view: &ldquo;when Cyrus did battle&hellip; against the army of Akkad, the people of Akkad retreated. He (sc. Cyrus) carried off the plunder (and) slaughtered the people&rdquo;. For my part, it seems only natural for ancient sources to overly praise one&rsquo;s rulers and vilify one&rsquo;s enemies, and neither the negative Babylonian presentation nor the positive Persian presentation are striking evidence for anything in particular. More interesting is her claim that the Cylinder text echoes earlier texts from Merodach-Baladan II (721) and Sargon II (710), such that Cyrus&rsquo;s claim that he has been selected for rule by Marduk because of the previous king&rsquo;s oppressive rule had been in vogue since the 8th century. She cites the repatriation of peoples and their gods as the &ldquo;concrete expression&rdquo; of this divine restoration, but it&rsquo;s unclear to me if she means that the previous kings also had such a policy. Either way, this is either evidence that Cyrus had precedent for restoring resident aliens to their homes, and therefore he probably did, or evidence that this was merely a literary convention, and therefore he probably didn&rsquo;t. I think the former is more convincing.</p>
<p>Therefore, my conclusion is that the Cyrus Cylinder almost definitely refers to an actual Edict that actually repatriated peoples and their gods to at least Sumer and Mesopotamia.</p>
<h3 id="ezra-nehemiah">Ezra-Nehemiah</h3>
<p>I have to preface this section by stating that I have spent the last day poring over hundreds of pages of peer-reviewed arguments over Ezra-Nehemiah&rsquo;s authenticity and historicity. There is no consensus that I can discern. There&rsquo;s a lot of controversy over a very small amount of text. I will present the most interesting and compelling arguments here.</p>
<p>The question at hand is, as I see it, over whether Cyrus facilitated the return of the Judeans to Judah, and not over whether Cyrus specifically supported the construction of a temple on Zion, so we will skip past arguments that Ezra-Nehemiah reflect an anti-Samaritan bias and delegitimization of worship at Mount Gerizim.</p>
<p>The Edict of Cyrus is presented in Ezra 1:2-4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. (KJV)</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether this fragment is an actual Persian proclamation or only written in the style of one, there are some interesting features to point out. Cyrus refers to the &ldquo;Lord God of heaven&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Lord God of Israel&rdquo;, consistent with the Persian government&rsquo;s policy that &ldquo;Persian administration necessarily styled the deities of the subject peoples in agreement with the phraseology used by the latter&rdquo; (Bickerman). Contemporary known-authentic documents employ this technique when referring to Marduk, Sin, Neith, and Khnum.</p>
<p>The translations make it rather confusing to figure out who is giving gold and silver to whom. At a glance, this looks reminiscent of the Hebrews <del>robbing</del> asking for gifts from the Egyptians on their way to the reed sea, but Bickerman proposes another reading. First, it is important to note that the Judeans maintained a distinct ethnic identity throughout the Exile. &ldquo;Among the ancients, a resident alien and his descendants preserved his original nationality indefinitely, unless he was admitted among the citizens&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and &ldquo;the Exiles formed communities under their own chiefs&hellip; Herodotus says that they lived in a village &lsquo;by themselves.&rsquo;&rdquo; Certainly, the construction of a historiography (Deut thru 2 Kings) that presented the destruction of Jerusalem as part of, and not contradictory to, the Covenant helped to maintain the Israelite-Judean religion in exile. In any case, Bickerman&rsquo;s analysis of the grammar in the Aramaic suggests that it is the Judeans who choose to remain in Babylon who are commanded to give gifts to those who are returning to Judah, to help them get established. A perfectly sound policy.</p>
<p>Ezra 6:10 gives Cyrus&rsquo;s motivation for allowing the Judeans to rebuild Jerusalem: &ldquo;That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.&rdquo; This is perfectly in line with the text of the Cylinder.</p>
<p>Thus far, the evidence suggests that the Edict, as presented in Ezra-Nehemiah, is plausibly authentic. We can&rsquo;t prove that it&rsquo;s authentic, but if it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a pretty convincing imitation. This seems to be Blankenship&rsquo;s position, who argues that &ldquo;Achaemenid strategies&hellip; are co-opted by the Jewish historian as well, and to some extent by the figures of Ezra and Nehemiah within the narrative&hellip; [T]he author of Ezra-Nehemiah&hellip; employs these authoritative Persian techniques, with guarantees of their power supplied both by literal Persian authorization and by the higher authority of YHWH, for the rhetorical purposes of asserting the self-determinacy and internal constitution of the Jewish Yehudite community after the return from Babylonia.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="obligatory-josephus-section">Obligatory Josephus Section</h3>
<p>The historicity of the Edict and return of Judeans to Judah is corroborated by Herodotus and Josephus, whom I consider to be <em>very poor historians</em>.</p>
<h3 id="trickle-theory">Trickle Theory</h3>
<p>Some sources suggested that the return from Babylon was not quite so dramatic and that it was a natural trickle of migration. Barring any substantial evidence for a significant wave of migration or for the authenticity of the Ezra-Nehemiah fragments, this is as good a theory as any.</p>
<p>In any case, we can be pretty sure that the Judeans who were in Judah during the Roman occupation are the same ones who returned from Babylon, regardless of how much Cyrus did or did not have to do with it.</p>
<h3 id="dna">DNA</h3>
<p>The DNA evidence (Katsnelson) is pretty consistent with the gradual emergence model and confirms that modern Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jews all originate from the Levant.</p>
<h2 id="political-philosophy">Political Philosophy</h2>
<p>All history is politically motivated. Archeological digs only get funded if somebody thinks they&rsquo;ll like what they find. Archeological records are easily destroyed by bulldozers and tree-planting projects.</p>
<p>It can be argued from the above evidence that Jews are indigenous to the Levant. How does the concept of indigeneity apply outside geographically isolated populations who were colonized and subjugated by the West (e.g. the Americas, Australia, New Zealand)? Would a claim to indigeneity justify the reconquest of the land? Did and do the Jews need or deserve a homeland in the aftermath of the Holocaust? To what degree is Britain responsible for creating and abandoning the most half-baked attempt at creating a modern nation-state ever? Why couldn&rsquo;t the new Jewish state have been somewhere else? Does the liturgically preserved longing for Jerusalem preclude any other geography?</p>
<p>For a detailed discussion of the political philosophies surrounding Zionism, anti-Zionism, etc., I refer you to Chaim Gans&rsquo;s <em>A Political Theory for the Jewish People</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Edict of Cyrus was most likely a real thing that happened.</p>
<p>Whether it applied to Judea is unclear, but the Judeans <em>did</em> return to Judea during Cyrus&rsquo;s reign, either by his invitation or via natural migration because he didn&rsquo;t stop them.</p>
<p>Political philosophy isn&rsquo;t fun for me. One side claims Jews are indigenous to the Levant and therefore have a right to the land. The other side claims that Jews are just European converts and have no claim to the land. DNA says Jews definitely came from the Levant. Compassion says they don&rsquo;t have a right to the land. Holocaust trauma says they need the land, whether they have an ancestral claim to it or not.</p>
<p>For my part, I agree with Samuel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>וַיֹּ֕אמֶר זֶ֗ה יִֽהְיֶה֙ מִשְׁפַּ֣ט הַמֶּ֔לֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִמְלֹ֖ךְ עֲלֵיכֶ֑ם אֶת־בְּנֵיכֶ֣ם יִקָּ֗ח וְשָׂ֥ם לוֹ֙ בְּמֶרְכַּבְתּ֣וֹ וּבְפָרָשָׁ֔יו וְרָצ֖וּ לִפְנֵ֥י מֶרְכַּבְתּֽוֹ׃</p>
<p>He said, “This will be the practice of the king who will rule over you: He will take your sons and appoint them as his charioteers and horsemen, and they will serve as outrunners for his chariots.</p>
<p>וְלָשׂ֣וּם ל֔וֹ שָׂרֵ֥י אֲלָפִ֖ים וְשָׂרֵ֣י חֲמִשִּׁ֑ים וְלַחֲרֹ֤שׁ חֲרִישׁוֹ֙ וְלִקְצֹ֣ר קְצִיר֔וֹ וְלַעֲשׂ֥וֹת כְּלֵֽי־מִלְחַמְתּ֖וֹ וּכְלֵ֥י רִכְבּֽוֹ׃</p>
<p>He will appoint them as his chiefs of thousands and of fifties; or they will have to plow his fields, reap his harvest, and make his weapons and the equipment for his chariots.</p>
<p>וְאֶת־בְּנוֹתֵיכֶ֖ם יִקָּ֑ח לְרַקָּח֥וֹת וּלְטַבָּח֖וֹת וּלְאֹפֽוֹת׃</p>
<p>He will take your daughters as perfumers, cooks, and bakers.</p>
<p>וְאֶת־שְׂ֠דֽוֹתֵיכֶ֠ם וְאֶת־כַּרְמֵיכֶ֧ם וְזֵיתֵיכֶ֛ם הַטּוֹבִ֖ים יִקָּ֑ח וְנָתַ֖ן לַעֲבָדָֽיו׃</p>
<p>He will seize your choice fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his courtiers.</p>
<p>וְזַרְעֵיכֶ֥ם וְכַרְמֵיכֶ֖ם יַעְשֹׂ֑ר וְנָתַ֥ן לְסָרִיסָ֖יו וְלַעֲבָדָֽיו׃</p>
<p>He will take a tenth part of your grain and vintage and give it to his eunuchs and courtiers.</p>
<p>וְֽאֶת־עַבְדֵיכֶם֩ וְֽאֶת־שִׁפְח֨וֹתֵיכֶ֜ם וְאֶת־בַּחוּרֵיכֶ֧ם הַטּוֹבִ֛ים וְאֶת־חֲמוֹרֵיכֶ֖ם יִקָּ֑ח וְעָשָׂ֖ה לִמְלַאכְתּֽוֹ׃</p>
<p>He will take your male and female slaves, your choice young men,-a and your asses, and put them to work for him.</p>
<p>צֹאנְכֶ֖ם יַעְשֹׂ֑ר וְאַתֶּ֖ם תִּֽהְיוּ־ל֥וֹ לַעֲבָדִֽים׃</p>
<p>He will take a tenth part of your flocks, and you shall become his slaves.</p>
<p>וּזְעַקְתֶּם֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֔וּא מִלִּפְנֵ֣י מַלְכְּכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּחַרְתֶּ֖ם לָכֶ֑ם וְלֹא־יַעֲנֶ֧ה יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם בַּיּ֥וֹם הַהֽוּא׃</p>
<p>The day will come when you cry out because of the king whom you yourselves have chosen; and the LORD will not answer you on that day.” (1 Samuel 8:11-18, JPS)</p></blockquote>

<p>Sigmund rose up, and sorrowed nigh to death over him; then he took the corpse in his arms and fared away to the wood, and went till he came to a certain firth; and there he saw a man in a little boat; and that man asked if he would be wafted by him over the firth, and he said yea thereto; but so little was the boat, that they might not all go in it at once, so the corpse was first laid therein, while Sigmund went by the firth-side. But therewith the boat and the man therein vanished away from before Sigmund&rsquo;s eyes. (Volsunga Saga, Ch. X)</p></blockquote>
<p>Animals, too, may serve psychopompic functions. Odin was accompanied by two ravens, and, indeed, Germanic stories often set the scene for bloodshed by indicating the presence of hungry ravens and wolves on the soon-to-be battlefield, eagerly awaiting their next meal. This connection suggests that the above definition is perhaps too limited in scope. Carrion animals do not guide the souls of the dead, but rather guide the corpses of the dead in their transformation from useless, decaying matter. Psychopomps are functionally transformational.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vultures orient us toward death as material transformation in a way that cares little for its cause&hellip; The vulture is a species that the ancient Greeks identified as a psychopomp — an animal guide to the other side, a greeter at death&rsquo;s door, a harbinger of demise. (Gray, 2017)</p></blockquote>
<p>If the vulture, raven, and wolf are psychopomps in the material sense, transforming dead <em>matter</em>, the function of the deity is <em>spiritual</em> transformation. Narratively this takes the form of a metaphysical journey. Charon ferries the soul across the River Styx. The Valkyrie carries the slain to Valhalla. But if we peek behind the metaphor, we can speculate that this spiritual transformation is one which prepares the soul for whatever comes next.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plato&rsquo;s dialogue, <em>Meno</em>, opens with this question by Meno: &ldquo;Can you tell me Socrates — is virtue something that can be taught? Or does it come by practice? Or is it neither teaching nor practice that gives it to a man but natural aptitude or something else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip; Whatever else the question entails properly as a consideration, it is a question about <em>change</em>: Can one go from a condition of being unlearned to one of being taught?&hellip;</p>
<p>Let us use one of Plato&rsquo;s own examples from the <em>Republic</em>, the allegory of the cave&hellip; Those who have managed to be freed from their fetters ascertain by the act of turning around from the wall where the shadows play that there is a source or a cause of the shadows. They can give themselves an adequate account (<em>logos</em>) of what they had seen, that the world of appearances is what they had known, and that world is henceforth known in terms of something else. When they make their way up out of the cave, coming to the surface of earth they — by practice now — are able to recognize their own and other images reflected in water by the light of the Sun&hellip; But what have they been taught? And by whom have they been taught?&hellip;</p>
<p>The allegory, which I am so briefly sketching here does not end with the emergence upon the surface of earth of those hitherto bound. They go back down into the cave to show, or to teach or to invite into the practice they have learned, those who remain there bound. There is, then, a very important sense in which such &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; are a kind of &ldquo;psychopomp&rdquo; leading the fettered soul from darkness to light&hellip;</p>
<p>Plato&rsquo;s psychopomps (my term, not Plato&rsquo;s) in his allegory of the cave show others where they have been and how they got there, even though they themselves do not <em>know</em> fully how they got there or even, indeed, where they arrived. They invite others into an activity. They invite others into a functioning freely — functioning freely, albeit alongside a dialectic (dia-logic) that is a <em>partial</em> account of what is happening to them. (Cooper, 1978)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is impossible to know, and pointless to speculate, how accurately the allegory of the cave applies to death, but the point remains that we can think of posthumous education as part of the role of the psychopomp. The psychopomp invites the deceased into the activity of death, whatever that may entail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tale tells that great fires were made endlong the hall, and the great tree aforesaid stood midmost thereof; withal folk say that, whenas men sat by the fires in the evening, a certain man came into the hall unknown of aspect to all men; and suchlike array he had, that over him was a spotted cloak, and he was bare-foot, and had linen-breeches knit tight even unto the bone, and he had a sword in his hand as he went up to the Branstock, and a slouched hat upon his head: huge he was, and seeming-ancient, and one-eyed. (Volsunga Saga, Ch. III)</p></blockquote>
<p>When we first meet Horse, Nadia is leaving her birthday party with Mike. She sees Horse across the street, leaning against a fence, asking passersby if they have a quarter. Mike sees her staring and asks, &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; to which Nadia replies, &ldquo;I think I know that guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later interactions with Horse will establish that she does not, in fact, know that guy.</p>
<p>The camera turns back around to Horse who is getting a light from another passerby. He takes a long drag on his cigarette while he stands barefoot, staring directly at the camera.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/horse01.webp" alt="Horse smoking"  />

(<em>Russian Doll</em>, S01E01)</p></blockquote>
<p>Minutes later, Nadia sees her missing cat, steps into the street to retrieve him, is hit by a cab, and dies for the first time.</p>
<p>In the next loop, Nadia sees him again at the same intersection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NADIA: I think I know this guy. Hey! Do I know you?</p>
<p>HORSE: What?</p>
<p>NADIA: Do we know each other?</p>
<p>HORSE: Fuck off. (<em>Russian Doll</em>, S01E01)</p></blockquote>
<p>We next see Horse in her next loop, playfully swinging on the fence. It is very cute.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. (Ecclesiastes 1:2, KJV)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Utter futility!—said Koheleth—<br>
Utter futility! All is futile! (Ecclesiastes 1:2, JPS, 1985)</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Vanity&rdquo; is an interesting translation choice. The Hebrew word is &ldquo;<em>hevel</em>&rdquo;, breath or vapor. <em>Hevel</em> is like a mist. You can see it, but when you reach out to grasp it your hand comes away empty. It is the illusion of substance, the promise of fulfillment. <em>Kohelet</em> laments that all is <em>hevel</em> because he has tried all things, virtue and vice alike, and found it all as impermanent as the morning fog.</p>
<p>As Nadia struggles to confront her (im)mortality, she throws herself fully into her birthday party. We see a montage of heavy drinking and drug use until Nadia passes out on the couch. <em>Hevel</em>, <em>hevel</em>! All is <em>hevel</em>!</p>
<h3 id="s01e03">S01E03</h3>
<p>Nadia is wandering drunk through the park.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HORSE: What&rsquo;s on your head? I said, what&rsquo;s on your head? Is that a wig or a hat?</p>
<p>NADIA: Where&rsquo;s your shoes, man?</p>
<p>HORSE: Mmm, someone stole them last night at the shelter, so I&rsquo;m not going back there, not ever. I don&rsquo;t sleep among thieves.</p>
<p>NADIA: Man, someone stole your shoes? Hey, what the fuck is going on in America, huh? What&rsquo;s your name, do I know you?</p>
<p>HORSE: No, you can call me Horse, if you want.</p>
<p>NADIA: Alright, Horse, I&rsquo;m Nadia. You want some?</p>
<p>HORSE: Can I tell you something?</p>
<p>NADIA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I&rsquo;m, mm, y&rsquo;know, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell me anything, you know, if I was you, because I&rsquo;m just not the kind of person that you tell secrets to. Uh, I&rsquo;m the abyss.</p>
<p><em>They both laugh uproariously.</em></p>
<p>HORSE: I wanna cut your hair. (<em>Russian Doll</em>, S01E03)</p></blockquote>
<p>Nadia immediately agrees. As Horse prepares his tools, Nadia jokes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can change your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Horse says, brandishing his scissors.</p>
<p>Cut to post-haircut. Horse holds up a tuft of severed hair.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HORSE: You see this? This is the old you. This is who you were day after day after day. But it&rsquo;s gone now. &lsquo;Cause this, this is the new you. Now you can be whoever you wanna be. (<em>Russian Doll</em>, S01E03)</p></blockquote>
<p>Nadia and Horse hunker down for the night and Nadia respawns in the bathroom having frozen to death. Nadia goes to the shelter to keep an eye on Horse&rsquo;s shoes. He warns her not to touch him while he sleeps because he&rsquo;s &ldquo;got reflexes.&rdquo; Nadia prevents the theft. When Horse awakens the next morning he looks Nadia in the eye, announces that he wants to cut her hair, and trots out of the shelter without another word.</p>
<h3 id="s01e04">S01E04</h3>
<p>Alan&rsquo;s approach to the time loop is to attempt to control every aspect of his day. When he meets Nadia, he learns that his control was an illusion. Confronted with his own powerlessness and the futility of his actions, he begins to fall apart, culminating with his breaking a mirror.</p>
<h3 id="s01e05">S01E05</h3>
<p>This episode is largely about Nadia failing to make amends with John by meeting Lucy and Alan failing to figure out why Beatrice cheated on him. None of it is terribly relevant to the current topic.</p>
<h3 id="s01e06">S01E06</h3>
<p>Nadia and Alan are at a bar. Alan notices Nadia&rsquo;s necklace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ALAN: That&rsquo;s pretty.</p>
<p>NADIA: Oh, this, this was my mother&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a <em>krugerrand</em>. You know what that is?</p>
<p>ALAN: May— No. No, I definitely don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>NADIA: It&rsquo;s a South African gold bullion. It goes for about, uh, $1,500 an ounce.</p>
<p>ALAN: Whoa. Cool.</p>
<p>NADIA: I told you my grandparents are Holocaust survivors, right?</p>
<p>ALAN: No, we basically just met. I&rsquo;m sorry about—</p>
<p>NADIA: It&rsquo;s not on you. Anyway, after the war, you know, most survivors were a little bit paranoid about putting their money in banks, so my grandparents acquired 150 of these babies, and then my mother, &lsquo;cause shes a fucking piece of work, she spent them all except for this one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nadia steals Alan&rsquo;s shoes and takes them to the park.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NADIA: Hey. Hey, Horse. Hey, man. Uh&hellip; Uh, Nadia. Yeah. It&rsquo;s me, I&rsquo;m your friend. You gave me a haircut.</p>
<p>HORSE: I don&rsquo;t know you.</p>
<p>NADIA: All right, be cool, man. Look, look, look, what size are you?
HORSE: What do you mean?</p>
<p><em>(NADIA holds up the shoes.)</em></p>
<p>HORSE: Come with me.</p>
<p>NADIA: All right. Where the fuck are we going?</p>
<p>HORSE: I got plants.</p>
<p><em>(Cut to the two of them smoking and huffing glue)</em></p>
<p>HORSE: I prefer casual acquaintances over closer relations, and strangers above everybody else, &lsquo;cause humanity&rsquo;s a fuck, man. I had this business partner once in the 90s when we were creating the dark web, and he got arrested because it was a scam and our government is a scam, and once I saw it was all just bullshit I just dropped out completely.</p>
<p>NADIA: How do you know that you&rsquo;re real?</p>
<p>HORSE: Huh?</p>
<p>NADIA: Do you think that we need people to be, like, witnesses?</p>
<p>HORSE: I&rsquo;m here. That&rsquo;s where you know. I&rsquo;m glad I lost everything. Technology, cryptocurrencies&hellip; It&rsquo;s all bullshit, man. You don&rsquo;t need any of that stuff. The more stuff you accumulate, the more space you take up. You know, people can&rsquo;t even pick me out of a lineup &lsquo;cause they don&rsquo;t remember me. I&rsquo;m a shadow, man.</p>
<p>NADIA: I think I&rsquo;m a shadow now, too.</p>
<p><em>(NADIA gives HORSE her necklace)</em></p>
<p>HORSE: Is that real gold? Why?</p>
<p>NADIA: It&rsquo;s too heavy. (<em>Russian Doll</em>, S01E06)</p></blockquote>
<p>Horse teaches Nadia that things are immaterial. Wealth and possessions are nothing. The person in front of you, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s real. And in response, she gives Horse the symbol of her resentment toward her mother. She sheds it as she did her hair three episodes ago.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Prequels occupy a unique space within their fictional universes. It would be reckless to suggest that <em>Ballad</em> truly precedes the main trilogy in thought, that Coriolanus&rsquo;s experiences with Lucy Gray inform his interactions with Katniss. On the contrary, Coriolanus&rsquo;s interactions with Katniss inform his interactions with Lucy Gray. The prequel novel draws on the material in the main trilogy and <em>recontextualizes</em> it to give the main trilogy a level of depth that it previously lacked.</p>
<p>Stylistically, <em>Ballad</em> is far removed from the main trilogy. The trilogy is young adult fiction through and through. Told in first-person present, we are given intimate access to Katniss&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings. Her youth, inexperience, and naïveté color our experience: we do not always see the world reliably because she does not. <em>Ballad</em> is written third person. We see glimpses of Coriolanus&rsquo;s thoughts only when the narrator allows it, and he is no more reliable than Katniss. We must watch Coriolanus from a distance, analyzing his words and deeds to discover his true thoughts.</p>
<p>In this essay, I contend that Coriolanus&rsquo;s youth is characterized by an internal and external struggle between good and evil. Coriolanus was not born the dictatorial Coriolanus Snow we know from the trilogy, nor is he forced into that role by purely external or environmental influence. Rather, in the mode of Greek tragedy, he forces himself into this role through the culmination of his own choices. These choices are the result of an unconscious proclivity toward selfish destructiveness.</p>
<h2 id="major-themes">Major themes</h2>
<h3 id="the-yetzer-hara">The yetzer hara</h3>
<p>Judaism posits the existence of two opposing forces in the human psyche: the <em>yetzer hatov</em> and the <em>yetzer hara</em>, or the Good Inclination and the Evil Inclination respectively.</p>
<p>While &ldquo;good and evil&rdquo; are acceptable rough translations of <em>tov</em> and <em>ra</em>, the English terms carry with them a significant amount of cultural baggage and connotations which do not necessarily agree with the Hebrew usages in the Hebrew Bible. A detailed examination is beyond the scope of the present essay, but we will adopt the translations &ldquo;good, beneficial [to the community], constructive&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil, useless or detrimental [to the community], destructive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The two inclinations constantly contend with each other. The <em>yetzer hara</em> is especially insidious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surely, if you do right,<br>
There is uplift.<br>
But if you do not do right<br>
Sin couches at the door;<br>
Its urge is toward you,<br>
Yet you can be its master. (<em>The Contemporary Torah</em>, 2006, Gen. 4:7)</p></blockquote>
<p>The power of the <em>yetzer hara</em> is on full display in the story of the Flood in Genesis. God wipes out all of humanity, save Noah and his family, in response to their rampant violence and injustice. Yet, God immediately repents of this act. Even God is powerless to defeat the <em>yetzer hara</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[God] smelled the pleasing odor, and [God] resolved: “Never again will I doom the earth because of humankind, since the devisings of the human mind are evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living being, as I have done. (<em>The Contemporary Torah</em>, 2006, Gen. 8:21)</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not to say that the <em>yetzer hara</em> is all-powerful. Gen 4:7 states unequivocally that &ldquo;you can be its master.&rdquo; It is, however, a constant and unending struggle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incidental to the verse, “Tremble, and do not sin,” the Gemara mentions that <strong>Rabbi Levi bar Ḥama said</strong> that <strong>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: One should always incite his good inclination against his evil inclination,</strong> i.e., that one must constantly struggle so that his evil inclination does not lead him to transgression, <strong>as it is stated: &ldquo;Tremble, and do not sin.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>If</strong> one succeeds and subdues his evil inclination, <strong>excellent,</strong> but <strong>if</strong> he does <strong>not</strong> succeed in subduing it, he should <strong>study Torah,</strong> as alluded to in <strong>the verse: “Say to your heart&hellip;</strong> (<em>Koren Talmud Bavli</em>, 2019, Berakhot 5a:2)</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>yetzer hara</em> can be overcome by, for example, constant study and meditation on Torah, that is, immersive study and meditation on the good.</p>
<p>These two impulses, their influence over man&rsquo;s actions and his struggle against or submission to them, provide a conceptual framework for Coriolanus&rsquo;s moral development.</p>
<h3 id="tigris-and-dr-gaul">Tigris and Dr. Gaul</h3>
<p>Dr. Gaul is a flat, static character. She is the representation of an idea, a certain approach to political philosophy and human nature. She does not change over the course of the narrative. Her function in the narrative is, essentially, to be the primary driving force in developing Coriolanus&rsquo;s worldview. She is the physical embodiment of the <em>yetzer hara</em>.</p>
<p>There are many characters who influence Coriolanus more positively than Dr. Gaul, but there is one character who, like Dr. Gaul, is relatively flat, static, and an unambiguously good influence. If any character can represent Coriolanus&rsquo;s <em>yetzer hatov</em>, it is Tigris.</p>
<p>An examination of these two&rsquo;s interactions with Coriolanus and the ways in which Coriolanus responds to and integrates their influence into his worldview and actions provide a window into his moral decline. They show Coriolanus&rsquo;s transformation from Coryo into President Snow.</p>
<h3 id="sejanus-and-lucy-gray">Sejanus and Lucy Gray</h3>
<p>If Tigris and Dr. Gaul are the angel and devil on Coriolanus&rsquo;s shoulders, Sejanus and Lucy Gray are the ultimately unfortunate victims of Coriolanus&rsquo;s decisions. Sejanus and Lucy Gray are more complex characters than Coriolanus&rsquo;s moral guides and have their own arcs, but in the context of <em>Ballad</em>&rsquo;s Coriolanus-centric narrative, they serve as Coriolanus&rsquo;s foils. Sejanus is Coriolanus&rsquo;s opposite in nearly every way: District born, new money, and sympathetic to the Districts&rsquo; suffering. Lucy Gray contrasts Coriolanus more subtly. She is everything that Coriolanus wishes to be: free, uninhibited, confident enough not to care what others think of her. It is precisely these qualities which cause Coriolanus to seek to control, dominate, and eventually despise her.</p>
<h3 id="on-impulse">On impulse</h3>
<p><em>Ballad</em>&rsquo;s third person limited viewpoint gives us glimpses into Coriolanus&rsquo;s thought processes. Coriolanus is analytical to a fault, always weighing the effects his words and deeds have on those around him, and especially on their perception of him. He tends to think and tread carefully. He is also a master of the art of retroactively rationalizing his behavior and that of others. This combination of traits makes him an outrageously unreliable narrator. He projects his own biases and assumptions about human nature on others uncritically, and consistently re-imagines the world around him to establish the rightness of his actions <em>post facto</em>.</p>
<p>This makes Coriolanus&rsquo;s internal monologue an unreliable tool for analyzing his actual beliefs. Instead, the reader must wrestle with Coriolanus&rsquo;s ever-changing understanding of his present moment. Objective fact eludes us, and we come away not with Coriolanus&rsquo;s <em>thoughts</em> but his <em>methods of thinking</em>. We are invited into Coriolanus&rsquo;s subjective experience of reality.</p>
<p>There are, however, a handful of moments which Coriolanus does not interpret for us, when he acts without premeditation. It is when Coriolanus acts without impulse that we get the clearest look into the values and beliefs at the center of his character.</p>
<h2 id="minor-themes">Minor themes</h2>
<h3 id="the-covey-and-the-citadel">The Covey and the Citadel</h3>
<p>Songbirds and snakes are prominent symbols in the novel. The Covey and the Citadel both employ each of them in different ways. Coriolanus&rsquo;s responses to symbols and those who employ them provide additional clues about his worldview.</p>
<h3 id="crassus-his-mother-and-the-grandmaam">Crassus, his mother, and the Grandma&rsquo;am</h3>
<p>Coriolanus feels tremendous pressure to live up to his family name as a Snow, despite his precarious relationship with his predecessors. The memory of his mother brings him comfort, but he sees in her an example of vulnerability and weakness. His relationship with his father was strained, but Crassus was a war hero and a source of inspiration. Coriolanus&rsquo;s internal conflict is, in part, an imaginary conflict between his mother and his father.</p>
<p>Nor can we ignore the fact of his having been raised by the Grandma&rsquo;am. No doubt, much of the obligation Coriolanus feels toward the Snow name is the result of the Grandma&rsquo;am&rsquo;s expectations of him. The naive childhood worldview and politics he holds at the beginning of the novel are a blend of postwar trauma and Grandma&rsquo;am&rsquo;s peculiar brand racism and classism.</p>
<h2 id="a-close-reading">A close reading</h2>
<p>With these themes in mind, we will embark on a close reading of the text in the hopes of mapping out the evolution of Coriolanus&rsquo;s core beliefs and moral decline.</p>
<h3 id="part-1-establishing-a-baseline">Part 1: Establishing a baseline</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Only his cousin&rsquo;s cleverness with a needle had saved him so far. (Collins, 2023, p. 3)</p></blockquote>
<p>The novel opens immediately with Coriolanus&rsquo;s insecurities about the fallen state of the Snow family. He is less concerned about the family&rsquo;s actual poverty (perhaps because, as a student, there is little he can do to remedy it) than with keeping up appearances. Tigris is essential to the deception upon which Coriolanus&rsquo;s self-esteem rests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every meal, she&rsquo;d rattle on about the Snows&rsquo; legendary grandeur, even when their fare consisted of watery bean soup and stale crackers&hellip; &ldquo;When Coriolanus is president&hellip;&rdquo; everything from the rickety Capitol air force to the exorbitant price of pork chops would be magically corrected. (p. 8)</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s uncertain how far back &ldquo;every meal&rdquo; goes, but it is clear that Coriolanus has long been steeped in stories of the Snows&rsquo; glory days. Coriolanus seems to begrudge these tales. He may consider them to be an indication of a state of denial, perhaps dementia setting in, or perhaps a simple refusal to accept the material reality of the present.</p>
<p>The Grandma&rsquo;am has high hopes for Coriolanus&rsquo;s future. Tigris, who has foregone University and brings in little money, is unlikely to be able to single-handedly drag the Snows out of poverty. That burden falls to Coriolanus. The Grandma&rsquo;am does not stop there, however. She expects Coriolanus to rise to the highest political office in the Capitol, and to miraculously solve all the Capitol&rsquo;s problems too! This is a heavy burden of expectation to place on an eighteen-year-old boy, especially one whose constant hunger makes such a dream seem like a ludicrous impossibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He noticed the lilac circles under her golden brown eyes&hellip; &ldquo;When was the last time you slept?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m fine. I ate the potato skins. They say that&rsquo;s where the vitamins are anyway. And today&rsquo;s the reaping, so it&rsquo;s practically a holiday!&rdquo; she said cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at Fabricia&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said&hellip; Tigris would spend the day waiting hand and food on her employer and her motley crew of guests&hellip; Tomorrow, nursing them through hangovers, would be worse. (p. 8)</p></blockquote>
<p>Tigris fixes Coriolanus&rsquo;s shirt dilemma at great cost to her own wellbeing. She loses an entire night of sleep before what are sure to be a grueling two days of labor at her abusive job, pulling through on nothing but potato skins. She insists that she will be fine to protect Coriolanus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It does look elegant. You know what her roses mean to her. Thank her.&rdquo; (p. 12)</p></blockquote>
<p>The narrative does not say whether Coriolanus would have thanked the Grandma&rsquo;am otherwise. Her prompting may imply that he would not have. Coriolanus&rsquo;s tendency to carefully manipulate those around him imply that he might have. Either way, Tigris is here literally functioning as the angel on Coriolanus&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was not the shield that caught Coriolanus&rsquo;s attention but Sejanus&rsquo;s outfit&hellip; The ensemble was stylish, brand-new, and smelling of money. War profiteering, to be exact&hellip; The Plinths now enjoyed privileges that the oldest, most powerful families had earned over generations&hellip;</p>
<p>For Coriolanus, the Plinths and their kind were a threat to all he held dear&hellip; It was particularly vexing because the bulk of the Snow family fortune had also been invested in munitions&hellip; The center of the Capitol&rsquo;s military manufacturing had shifted to District 2 and fallen right into the Plinths&rsquo; laps. (pp. 16-17)</p></blockquote>
<p>Sejanus&rsquo;s outfit is the opposite of Coriolanus&rsquo;s. Coriolanus&rsquo;s shirt is old and was barely made presentable in time. Sejanus&rsquo;s is brand new. Coriolanus has lived in the shadow of the legend of the Snow family name. The Plinths, new money, are enjoying the privileges which the Snows have lost. Coriolanus is keenly aware of this.</p>
<p>Coriolanus views the Plinths as a threat. To Coriolanus, Sejanus is a usurper, taking for himself what is rightfully the Snows&rsquo;. The fact that the Plinths made their fortune in the same industry that once made the Snows theirs rubs salt in the wound. Sejanus being Distict born is a direct threat to Coriolanus&rsquo;s sense of hereditary entitlement, which he seemed to resent mere pages ago but which he seems to have accepted as one of his core beliefs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No, not really. But only because she hasn&rsquo;t thought of it,&rdquo; said Coriolanus, seesawing between disdain and camaraderie. (p. 19)</p></blockquote>
<p>A gentleman of good breeding must always present himself amicably, so Coriolanus jabs at Sejanus in the most passive-aggressive semi-self-depracating way imaginable. We will see Coriolanus keep up this seesawing as his opinions and attitudes toward Sejanus vacillate over the course of their relationship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ma? Was Coriolanus&rsquo;s place about to be usurped by someone who referred to his mother as &ldquo;Ma&rdquo;? (p. 20)</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough for Sejanus to be District born in theory. His blatant disregard for Capitol etiquette is the cherry on the sandwich, and a clear indication of Coriolanus&rsquo;s blatant classist prejudices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you happy? District Two, the boy — that&rsquo;s the pick of the litter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget. I&rsquo;m part of that litter,&rdquo; said Sejanus hoarsley.</p>
<p>Coriolanus let that sink in. So ten years in the Capitol and the privileged life it provided had been wasted on Sejanus. He still thought of himself as a district citizen. Sentimental nonsense.</p>
<p>Sejanus&rsquo;s forehead creased in consternation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure my father requested it. He&rsquo;s always trying to get my mind right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>No doubt</em>, though Coriolanus. Old Strabo Plinth&rsquo;s deep pockets and influence were respected if his lineage was not. And while the mentorships were supposedly based on merit, strings clearly had been pulled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus makes two assumptions here, both wrong. The first is that the boys are obviously more likely to win the Hunger Games because they are naturally stronger than girls. Even if we make allowances for the pre-bombing arena making the Hunger Games largely a close-quarters bloodbath, his sexism is questionable at best, and indicative of his attitude toward women in general. The second is that Sejanus cares as much about winning as Coriolanus does. Coriolanus fails to remember that Sejanus is from District Two and may know his tribute personally, and fails to imagine that anybody would have moral reservations about the Hunger Games at all. We might conclude that Capitol citizens may find the Hunger Games distasteful but do not fundamentally condemn them; they are ugly but necessary and just. Or perhaps Coriolanus is projecting his own attitude onto his peers.</p>
<p>Coriolanus&rsquo;s resentment toward Sejanus only grows when he realizes his usurper isn&rsquo;t even grateful for the privileged position he occupies. Sejanus takes his wealth and status for granted while Coriolanus starves.</p>
<p>We know little to nothing about Sejanus&rsquo;s academic record, so it is unclear what Coriolanus means by &ldquo;merit&rdquo;. What is clear is Coriolanus&rsquo;s sense of entitlement. He is entitled to the best tribute, and he is entitled to the recognition of his peers and teachers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lucy Gray Baird stood upright in a dress made of rainbow ruffles, now raggedy but once fancy. (p. 24)</p></blockquote>
<p>Lucy Gray&rsquo;s dress matches Coriolanus&rsquo;s shirt, once an indication of prosperity, now stained and tattered. Crassus&rsquo;s old shirt, however, was part of his military ensemble, and has been redone to mask the Snows&rsquo; poverty. Lucy Gray&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s dress is almost gaudy and meant for performance and entertainment. Despite its deteriorated state, it is deceptive in its own right: what is a performance if not an elaborate lie?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus scanned the crowd and felt a spark of hope. His long shot of a tribute, his throwaway, his insult had captured the Capitol&rsquo;s attention&hellip; With his help, perhaps she could keep it, and he could turn disgrace into a respectable showing. (p. 25)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus&rsquo;s interest in Lucy Gray begins and ends with himself. He sees her as an object, disposable, first as an insult given him by Dean Highbottom, then as a tool for his own gain. There is an implicit assumption that Lucy Gray will not win the Hunger Games. Her death is a given. This may play into Coriolanus&rsquo;s thinking of her as less than human. The Districts are savage rebels, murderers, Lucy Gray is not a victim but just recompense, and if she will be dead soon anyway, he need not dwell too deeply on the moral implications of his thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She managed to blow a kiss before they were on her. &ldquo;My friends call me Lucy Gray — I hope you will, too!&rdquo; she called out. (p. 29)</p></blockquote>
<p>Lucy Gray shares Coriolanus&rsquo;s desire to have some control over how others view her. Here, we might conclude that her manipulation is an innocent facet of her role as a performer. The audience is aware of the conceit in a way that Coriolanus&rsquo;s peers are not. We will see how this desire develops later on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cousins never spoke of it, even to each other, but it was burned into Coriolanus&rsquo;s memory&hellip; the absolute horror of realizing that he, too, could now be viewed as edible. (p. 32)</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite a trauma for one so young. Coriolanus learned early on the savagery that humanity is capable of, and this no doubt defined his growth into a paranoid and self-serving young adult. We have seen Tigris take this as a call to action to be generous and compassionate, to prevent such atrocities from being necessary. It is tragic that they never spoke of it—perhaps Coriolanus would have been able to process the trauma more effectively—but Tigris, a child herself, could hardly be blamed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It fell to eight-year-old Tigris to boil the beans to the thick stew, then the soup, then the watery broth, which was to sustain them throughout the war. (p. 33)</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Tigris has been selflessly ensuring the Snows&rsquo; survival from an extremely young age. Although she was forced into the role by the war and the Grandma&rsquo;am&rsquo;s incompetence, we are given no indication that she is dissatisfied with her lot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collecting taxes from Sejanus Plinth in his palatial apartment on the Corso while he lived in some rat hole fifty blocks out? (p. 36)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus is prone to catastrophizing. The minute he hears a rumor that might threaten his family&rsquo;s tenuous finances, he imagines himself living in a hovel and collecting taxes from the Plinths in an apartment much like his own once was. This explicit inversion of the Capitol-District relationship that threatens the foundation of Coriolanus&rsquo;s worldview is entirely imagined, a product of his own paranoia and penchant for overthinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cousins agreed that he needed to make a good first impression on the girl so that she would be willing to work with him. He should treat her not as a condemned prisoner, but as a guest&hellip; It would give him a jump on the assignment, as well as an opportunity to win her trust.
&ldquo;Imagine how terrified she must be, Coryo,&rdquo; Tigris had said. &ldquo;How alone she must feel. If it was me, anything you could do to make me feel like you cared about me would go a long way&hellip; Like I was of value.&rdquo; (pp. 37-38).</p></blockquote>
<p>The direct quote from Tigris demonstrates her empathy. She <em>does</em> view Tigris as a human with human emotions, not as a condemned prisoner or subhuman District scum. Coriolanus, on the other hand, views treating Lucy Gray well as a means to an end. He seeks to gain her trust so that he can leverage it to bolster his grade. His trip to the train station is motivated not by a desire to make Lucy Gray feel safe and wanted, but to get a head start over his peers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another girl, a typical girl, would be impressed, but there was nothing typical about Lucy Gray Baird. In fact there was something intimidating about a girl who&hellip; had dropped a venomous snake down another girl&rsquo;s dress. Of course, he didn&rsquo;t know that it was venomous, but that was where the mind went, wasn&rsquo;t it? She was terrifying, really. And here he was&hellip; hoping she would — what? Like him? Trust him? Not kill him on sight? (p. 39)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus makes some outrageous assumptions here. He firstly assumes that the snake Lucy Gray dropped down Mayfair&rsquo;s dress was poisonous, and justifies this assumption by presenting it as the logical conclusion that anybody would drop. We have no evidence that this is the case. It seems rather to be a manifestation of his intense paranoia. He fears her without any real reason to, going so far as to suspect that she might murder him in cold blood.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note his fearful reaction to the snake, despite his characterization in the Trilogy as being snake-like himself. He has yet to adopt poison as his <em>modus operandi</em>, nor has he yet consciously accepted his tendency toward deception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They really were creatures out of another world. A hopeless, brutish world. (p. 41)</p></blockquote>
<p>Another example of Coriolanus thinking of the tributes as subhuman. They are, to his mind, inherently animalistic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s my mentor. Supposed to help me. I might need him.&rdquo; (p. 46)</p></blockquote>
<p>Since we lack access to Lucy Gray&rsquo;s actual thoughts in this moment, we can only speculate. If we take her at her word, it seems that Lucy Gray is taking advantage of Coriolanus in the same way that he is taking advantage of her. They are compatriots in this respect, perhaps laying the groundwork for their budding relationship. It is also possible that this is merely an excuse to save his life, something that she thinks the other tributes will accept. At the very least, we know that Lucy Gray is not helpless. She is able to adapt to Coriolanus&rsquo;s role as her mentor and is ready to make use of this unexpected resource.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without turning he knew it was the girl, his girl&hellip; (p. 49)</p></blockquote>
<p><em>His</em> girl. Lucy Gray is his property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lucy Gray raised her hand to meet his but refrained from sticking it through the bars, which might have appeared threatening. (p. 51)</p></blockquote>
<p>Lucy Gray is keenly aware of her surroundings and how she appears to those around her. She knows how to take control of appearances, and acts in just the right way to diffuse the fear of her Capitol audience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus could sense the audience beginning to warm up to his tribute, no longer bothering to keep their distance. People were easy to manipulate when it came to their children. (p. 52)</p></blockquote>
<p>Lucy Gray is a performer by trade. It is entirely possible that her situational awareness and social skills are simply the result of professional experience. Coriolanus, however, assumes that this is an intentional manipulation, betraying his own manipulative tendencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good at games. Maybe one day you&rsquo;ll be a Gamemaker.&rdquo; (p. 59)</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Game recognize game,&rdquo; as the saying goes. Dr. Gaul immediately sees in Coriolanus a kindred soul: he is quick on his feet, takes initiative, and is a natural manipulator. He passes her test, and she makes the decision to take him under her wing right away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is if no one watches!&rdquo; she snapped back. She gave Coriolanus an indulgent smile. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a child himself. Give him time. I&rsquo;ve got a good feeling about this one&hellip;&rdquo; (p. 60)</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Gaul explicitly acknowledges her recognition of Coriolanus&rsquo;s potential before excusing herself. Coriolanus&rsquo;s thoughts about the Hunger Games, the role they play, and the nature of humanity are implicitly laid out for his future education.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was Sejanus up to? Was he trying to outdo him and steal the day&rsquo;s thunder? To take his idea of coming to the zoo and then dress it up in a way Coriolanus could never compete with, because he could never afford to? (p. 63)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus cannot conceive in a world in which Sejanus feeds the Tributes purely out of altruism, empathy, or compassion. He must assume that Sejanus is trying to compete with him. We see again his insecurities about Sejanus&rsquo;s wealth and status.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure. The optics so far were good, singling her out again, presenting her as someone of value. But to eat with her? That might cross a line. (p. 65)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus here implies Lucy Gray&rsquo;s subhuman status. She is an object. An object of value, to be sure, and it is especially valuable to him if others see her as valuable as well. But to eat with her as though she were a fellow human, a fellow citizen of Panem? That surely crosses a line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus didn&rsquo;t like sharing the spotlight, but Sejanus&rsquo;s presence could protect him&hellip; he would&rsquo;ve thought the name Snow carried more weight than Plinth, but&hellip; he&rsquo;d prefer to have Sejanus by his side. (pp. 66-67)</p></blockquote>
<p>A begrudging friendship based on expedience is born. It is interesting to note Coriolanus&rsquo;s lackluster and ignorant response to the episode between Sejanus and Marcus. Coriolanus is keenly aware that Sejanus is from District Two, but he fails to see any reason for the strain between the two. To Coriolanus, it is as if Sejanus&rsquo;s life began when he moved to the Capitol. Anything before then is part of a dark, primordial past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, in the relative privacy of the corner, he realized for the first time that she would be dead in a few days&hellip; he had thought about her more as his contender. His filly in a race, his dog in a fight. The more he treated her as something special, the more she&rsquo;d become human&hellip; Lucy Gray was not really an animal, even if she was not Capitol. (p. 68)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus invokes the images of horse racing and dog fighting. He explicitly acknowledges his thinking of her as subhuman, and his treatment of her as an animal. She had value only insofar as it allowed Coriolanus to sell tickets to the show, so to speak. And yet, he has begun to recognize something human in her. Coriolanus attributes this to his own actions — it is his treatment of her that elevates her. However, we have seen his appreciation of her talents, the personality traits they share, and their subsequently growing camaraderie. It is becoming increasingly difficult not to recognize Lucy Gray&rsquo;s humanity. We will see whether this changes once she is no longer behind bars.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His mother used to sing him a song at bedtime. Not this one, exactly, but it had used those same words&hellip; He could sense her presence, almost smell the delicate scent of the rose powder she wore, and feel the warm blanket of security that had enveloped him each night. (pp. 70-71)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus associates his mother with delicacy and the scent of roses, security and the feeling of warmth. And now, thanks to Lucy Gray&rsquo;s singing, he associates his mother with Lucy Gray. It may be partly because of his love of, or longing for, his late mother that he develops such strong feelings for Lucy Gray.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He again felt the bitterness of a Plinth being granted the mightiest tribute. And he was tired of Sejanus whining over his father&rsquo;s buying him the victor. (p. 73)</p></blockquote>
<p>Here, Coriolanus seems to be comparing himself to the proverbial &ldquo;starving children in Africa.&rdquo; What right does Sejanus have to complain when there are poor, underprivileged kids like Coriolanus in the world? As if it weren&rsquo;t bad enough that Coriolanus&rsquo;s position has been usurped, it could not have been given to a more ungrateful subject!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was one more consideration. He had something Sejanus Plinth wanted, and wanted badly. Sejanus had already usurped his position, his inheritance, his clothes, his candy, his sandwiches, and the privilege due a Snow. Now he was coming for his apartment, his spot at the University, his very future, and he had the gall to be resentful of his good fortune. To reject it. To consider it a punishment, even. If having Marcus as a tribute made Sejanus squirm, then good. Let him squirm. Lucy Gray was one thing belonging to Coriolanus that he would never, ever get. (pp. 74-75)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus comes close to trading Lucy Gray, <em>his girl</em>, for who he assumes will be the winning tribute. Interestingly, he seems to value spite above maximizing his chances to win the Games and Plinth Prize. Is this envy, hatred, or mere sadism?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a mirror, so I can only imagine.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t bother to put on her sparkly camera personality for him, and in a way he was glad. Maybe she was beginning to trust him. (p. 85)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus continues to see Lucy Gray as a means to an end. Her trust increases his chances of making a good impression. We also see his naivety and the narrowness of his self-centered perception. He sees as an expression of trust what could just as easily be exhaustion, resignation, a strategic reservation of energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Are you asking?&rdquo; said Lucy Gray seriously. He looked up in surprise. &ldquo;Because I think this could work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coriolanus felt himself blush a little at her teasing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure you could do better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t yet.&rdquo; A flicker of pain crossed her face, but she hid it with a smile. &ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;ve got sweethearts lined up around the block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her flirtation left Coriolanus tongue-tied. (pp. 86-87)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is impressive how little it takes to get Coriolanus riled up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My mother always smelled like roses,&rdquo; he said, and then felt awkward. He rarely mentioned his mother, even at home. (p. 89)</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it is Coriolanus who is beginning to trust Lucy Gray. This is certainly an unprecedented level of vulnerability. Even around Tigris, he seems to be at least somewhat cautious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus&rsquo;s initial reaction was to recoil like the others, to grab hold of the monkey house bars for support, but Lucy Gray hissed, &ldquo;Help her!&rdquo; He remembered the cameras streaming live to the Capitol audience. He had no idea what to do for Arachne, but he did not want to be seen cringing and clinging. His terror was a private thing, not meant for public display.</p>
<p>He forced his legs into motion and was the first to reach Arachne. (p. 100)</p></blockquote>
<p>This scene recalls Lucy Gray&rsquo;s advice to &ldquo;own it&rdquo; when Coriolanus first landed in the monkey house. In this case, however, it seems far more likely that Lucy Gray is concerned for Arachne&rsquo;s life, not for how Coriolanus looks in front of the cameras. Lucy Gray may be attempting to act as Coriolanus&rsquo;s <em>yetzer hatov</em>, but it is his <em>yetzer hara</em>, his desire to look good for the cameras and hide his unflattering terror, that actually spurs him to action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll just send the tributes home.&rdquo; The idea was not entirely unappealing when he thought of Lucy Gray. Hy wondered how the fallout from Arachne&rsquo;s death was affecting her. Were all the tributes being punished? Would they allow him to see her?&quot; (p. 189)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus seems to be developing some sort of empathy, or, at least, sympathy for Lucy Gray. It is, however, still tempered by his own desire to see her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is a point to everything or nothing at all, depending on your worldview,&rdquo; said Dr. Gaul. &ldquo;Which brings me to your proposal. I like it. Who wrote it? Just you two? Or did your brassy friend weigh in before her throat was cut?&rdquo; (p. 111)</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, Camus.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, Dr. Gaul&rsquo;s callousness toward Arachne&rsquo;s death is noteworthy. It is an attitude Coriolanus will slowly, but surely, adopt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus had just begun to put two and two together when he saw the look of alarm on Clemensia&rsquo;s face. She yanked her hand fromt he tank, but not before a half dozen neon snakes sank their fangs into her flesh. (p. 113)</p></blockquote>
<p>Snakes. Fear. Deception. Lavish displays of violence. No doubt this incident is a defining moment in young Coriolanus&rsquo;s life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He buried his head in his hands, confused, angry, and most of all afraid. Afraid of Dr. Gaul. Afraid of the Capitol. Afraid of everything. If the people who were supposed to protect you played so fast and loose with your life&hellip; then how did you survive? Not by trusting them, that was for sure. And if you couldn&rsquo;t trust them, who could your trust? All bets were off. (p. 116)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus&rsquo;s catastrophizing is here on full display, as is his selfishness. Sejanus doesn&rsquo;t trust the Capitol either, but his response is to selflessly risk his own personal safety and comfort to help the districts. Coriolanus&rsquo;s response is to shrug off any obligation to society and look out only for number one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strangely, he found the only person he wanted to talk to was Lucy Gray, who was both clever and unlikely to repeat his words. (p. 117)</p></blockquote>
<p>Coriolanus chooses to confide in Lucy Gray because she is about to die. To whom can she confide? His secrets are safe with her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m participating in them. I&rsquo;m helping them happen!&rdquo; His head dropped in shame. &ldquo;I should be like Sejanus and at least try to quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Ignoring the guard&rsquo;s warning, he impulsively stepped over the rock and crouched down across the bars from her. &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; She nodded, but she didn&rsquo;t look all right. He&rsquo;d wanted to tell her about the scare with the snakes and Clemensia&rsquo;s brush with death. He&rsquo;d hoped to ask her advice, but it all paled in comparison to her situation. He remembered the crackers the nurse had given him and fumbled for the crumpled packets in his pocket. &ldquo;I brought you these. They&rsquo;re not big, but they&rsquo;re very nutritious.&rdquo; (pp. 120-121)</p></blockquote>
<p>Genuine empathy! Genuine feelings of guilt for his role in the senseless slaughter of children! Here he recognizes that Sejanus is moral, and that he is not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You matter to me,&rdquo; he insisted. The Capitol may not value her, but he did. Hadn&rsquo;t he just poured his heart out to her? (p. 122)</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Coriolanus saying that she matters as a result of his actions, or are his actions the result of her mattering?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world is but a perpetual see-saw&hellip; I do not portray his being; I portray his passage; not a passage from one age to another&hellip; but from day to day, from minute to minute. I must suit my story to the hour, for soon I may change, not only by chance but also by intention. It is a record of various and variable occurrences, an account of thoughts that are unsettled and, as chance will have it, at times contradictory, either because I am then another self, or because I approach my subject under different circumstances and with other considerations. (Keightley &amp; Pickering, 2014, p. 15)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Trauma] is a condition of individual psychic damage of such severity that the person who suffers from it is unable to make experience storyable and knowable. (Keightley &amp; Pickering, 2014, p. 168)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is because remembered experience is constitutive of our successive selves as these inform our sense of identity through time that the distinguishing feature of traumatic experience is its denial or severe inhibition of [a resynthesis of the traumatic memory]. (Keightley &amp; Pickering, 2014, p. 170)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I put this basically enough? It&rsquo;s a philosophical theory, the kind you might encounter if you took time to read some books. The fundamental premise is to envision history as a sequence of &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo; conflicts. Each dialectic begins with a proposition, a thesis, which inherently contains, or creates, its opposite - an antithesis. Thesis and antithesis. The conflict is inevitable.</p>
<p>But the resolution of the conflict yields something new - a synthesis - eliminating the flaws in each, leaving behind common elements and ideas. (Obsidian Entertainment, 2010)</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="a-post-apocalyptic-prometheus">A post-apocalyptic Prometheus</h3>
<p>Prometheus has been reinvented and reinterpreted time and again since his entrance into the (extant) literary canon in the 8th century BCE. For our purposes, it is sufficient to say that Prometheus is a titan who defies the will of the gods by bringing Fire to humanity.</p>
<p>Prometheus&rsquo;s identity as a titan is significant. The titans are older and more powerful than the gods, but were overthrown by them. Prometheus is the last remnant of a fallen race and lives now in a social and cosmic order defined and determined by the gods. Prometheus is powerful enough to defy the will of the gods, but not powerful enough to escape punishment. The consequence of his rebellion is to have his liver eaten daily by birds, only to have it regrow to be eaten again <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p>
<p>Coriolanus Snow, too, is the last of a once-great, now-fallen dynasty. The Snows were once among the most powerful of Capitol&rsquo;s family, but they have been brought low and replaced by a new order of Plinths.</p>
<p>But while Prometheus&rsquo;s Fire was knowledge, technology, philosophy, and society, stolen from the gods and given to lowly humans, those are not things wanted nor needed by the &ldquo;lowly&rdquo; Districts. Snow&rsquo;s Fire is compassion, kindness, love, and empathy. Snow&rsquo;s Fire is that indwelling spirit of human goodness which the Districts possess and the Capitol lacks. Prometheus is moved by pity to give Fire to humanity. Snow is unable to be moved by anything but disdain.</p>
<p>When Snow sees the Fire of humanness in Sejanus, he snuffs it out. When he cannot control the Fire of freedom in Lucy Gray, he stifles it. Prometheus is blinded by the temptation of the Fire; Snow is blinded by the status quo, so invested in conforming to the power structure of the gods&rsquo; world to even recognize the Fire&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>Prometheus is a hero, and he suffers the tragic fate of a hero. Snow is no such thing. He is the Capitol&rsquo;s faithful servant and lives a long life.</p>

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the 4th Century CE, in bustling Alexandria, Egypt, a presbyter name Arius argued that Jesus Christ was a &amp;ldquo;god from nothing&amp;rdquo;. He believed that Jesus was created &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt;, from nothing, the same way that the rest of Creation was. While he may have believed Jesus was the Son of God, and was divine himself, he was not himself God, or made up of the same substance as God.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

<p>In the middle of the 4th Century CE, in bustling Alexandria, Egypt, a presbyter name Arius argued that Jesus Christ was a &ldquo;god from nothing&rdquo;. He believed that Jesus was created <em>ex nihilo</em>, from nothing, the same way that the rest of Creation was. While he may have believed Jesus was the Son of God, and was divine himself, he was not himself God, or made up of the same substance as God.</p>
<p>Arius and his followers became known as Arians, and they would spark a centuries-long conflict in the early Christian Church.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Arius, Alexandria was also home to a deacon by the name of Athanasius. Athanasius would dedicate his life to stamping out the Arian Heresy.</p>
<p>Athanasius was a strong believer in the consubstantiality of God and Christ. He argued that God and Jesus were not only made up of the same stuff, but were co-eternal and co-equal. Jesus was not created, but existed alongside and as a part of God from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The battle between Arius and Athanasius came to a head at the Council of Nicea in 325 CE, where Athanasius would succeed in persuading Church leadership to his view. Arius and his followers were successfully branded heretics. Still, popular support for Arianism was strong, and its supporters included Emperor Constantine the Great. It would take several more decades for the early Church to fully stamp out the Arian Heresy.</p>
<p>The Council of Nicea was not only important for what it condemned, but for what it proclaimed. Out of the Council emerged two important cornerstones of world Christendom: the elevation of the books of John and Revelation, and the writing of the Nicene Creed.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the Council of Nicea was not responsible for the canonization of the Christian Bible. The Roman Catholic Church would not declare an official canon until fifty years later at the Council of Rome in 382 CE, and most of the books adopted were already widely accepted and circulated throughout the early Church.</p>
<p>In 140 CE, Marcion of Sinope drew up a list of texts which he considered canonical. Marcion&rsquo;s list included a good deal of the present-day New Testament canon, including Luke, Galatians, I and II Corinthians, Romans, I and II Thessalonians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon, and Philippians.</p>
<p>In roughly 180 CE, Irenaeus advocated for the four-gospel canon and drew on all of the books in the present-day New Testament except Philemon, II Peter, III John, and Jude in his treatise <em>Against Heresies</em>.</p>
<p>By 200 CE, Origen of Alexandria was (probably) using the same list of 27 books that we have today.</p>
<p>Canonization took place gradually over centuries, and was influenced by what early Christians were <em>actually</em> reading and circulating. It was not imposed on the Church by its leaders, but was formulated from the bottom up before being officially accepted.</p>
<p>The Council of Nicea did, however, put to rest much of the early Church&rsquo;s discomfort with the books of John and Revelation. The Gospel of John is the only Gospel not to follow the Synoptic formula and expresses many ideas which seem to align with gnosticism, another heresy the early Church worked hard to destroy. Revelation is a bizarre revenge fantasy about Jesus returning to lead his people in violent revolt against Rome, disguised as apocalypse literature (a genre of literature in which readers &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; were expected to unpack dense metaphors to uncover the true meaning of the text).</p>
<p>They hardly seem to fit in with the rest of the New Testament canon, but Athanasius fought to defend them and to elevate them to stand on equal footing with the other books. They were perfect weapons against Arianism.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John begins, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&hellip; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.&rdquo; Clearly Jesus was not created, but is co-eternal and co-equal with God! Likewise, the Book of Revelation is filled to the brim with colorful illustrations of Christ&rsquo;s divine nature and authority.</p>
<p>So the Church leadership at the Council of Nicea reached consensus regarding the Arian Heresy and had Scripture to support their stance. For the sake of the unity of the Church, and to combat the spread of Arianism and other heretical ideas, they formulated the Nicene Creed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible.</p>
<p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father [the only-begotten; that is, of the essence of the Father, God of God,] Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;</p>
<p>By whom all things were made [both in heaven and on earth];</p>
<p>Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down and was incarnate and was made man;</p>
<p>He suffered, and the third day he rose again, ascended into heaven;</p>
<p>From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>And in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>[But those who say: 'There was a time when he was not;' and 'He was not before he was made;' and 'He was made out of nothing,' or 'He is of another substance' or 'essence,' or 'The Son of God is created,' or 'changeable,' or 'alterable'&mdash; they are condemned by the holy catholic and apostolic Church.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus was Christian orthodoxy born. Or, at least, codified.</p>
<h2 id="orthodoxy-and-orthopraxy">Orthodoxy and orthopraxy</h2>
<p>Orthodoxy, Greek for &ldquo;correct belief&rdquo;, has been baked into the fabric of the Western worldview for millennia. Most aspects of an individual&rsquo;s identity are defined by belief. A Christian believes in the divinity, death, and resurrection of Christ. An atheist believes that there is no God and that science and reason are the key to living a fulfilling moral life. A Democrat believes in using the power of government to aid and uplift marginalized groups. Republicans believe in individuals&rsquo; freedom to do as they please with their hard-earned resources without government interference. Some trans people believe that their gender is determined by their internal alignment with socially defined gender roles. Some gay people believe that their same-sex attraction is an intrinsic part of their identity as much as is their height, shoe size, or love of pizza (I am assuming, correctly, that loving pizza is a universal constant).</p>
<p>Often, I am asked what Jews believe. Sometimes the question is asked by somebody who knows little about Judaism and is hoping to get a general sense for what Judaism is all about. Sometimes the question is more specific: &ldquo;What do Jews believe about such and such?&rdquo; Regardless, my answer is always the same, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Which Jews, and when, and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike so many Western religions, Judaism is not orthodoxic. Judaism is orthopraxic; it emphasizes correct action over correct belief. That makes talking about Jewish beliefs a little tricky.</p>
<p>In general, Jews believe in one God. We say the <em>shema</em>, a prayer declaring the Oneness of God, multiple times a day. However, not all Jews believe in God. Many Jews lost their faith in God in the face of the Holocaust, and they are still Jewish. Some humanistic and secular Jews may not believe in God, and they are still Jewish. Some Jews are pantheists, believing that God is not a distinct entity but that all things are God, and they are still Jewish. I can generally count on a Chabadnik to have some <em>tefillin</em> I can borrow, but I can&rsquo;t as easily predict his thoughts, feelings, or beliefs beyond &ldquo;Yes, you should wrap <em>tefillin</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been some attempts to capture in writing the spirit of Jewish beliefs. The famous medieval rabbi Maimonides wrote one such list of <em>13 Principles of Faith</em>. However, we are pretty sure his list was an attempt to explain Judaism to non-Jews in the hopes that they would ease up a little on the Jewish community. It is not widely known or accepted by the majority of world Jewry, and is of extremely limited actual usefulness.</p>
<p>Judaism as a religion is, instead, focused on observing the <em>mitzvot</em>, acts of religious observance commanded by God in the Torah. Some <em>mitzvot</em> are positive: you <em>should</em> give charity, or you <em>should</em> pray the <em>shema</em> before you go to sleep. Some <em>mitzvot</em> are negative: you <em>should not</em> work on the Sabbath, or you <em>should not</em> eat pork. There aren&rsquo;t any <em>mitzvot</em> telling Jews what they should or should not believe in, only what they should or should not do.</p>
<p>A non-Jew said to Rabbi Hillel, &ldquo;I will convert to Judaism if you can teach me the whole of the Torah while I stand on one foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rabbi Hillel replied, &ldquo;What is hateful to you, do not do to another. That is the whole of the Torah. The rest is commentary. Go and study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiva added, &ldquo;Love the other as you love yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most repeated commandment in the Hebrew Bible is to be kind to the strangers, for you were strangers in Egypt and you know how it feels to be oppressed.</p>
<p>Of course, not all Jews observe the <em>mitzvot</em>, or observe the <em>mitzvot</em> to various degrees. Plenty of Jews eat bacon or go to work on Friday, and they are still Jews. A child born to Jewish parents and raised in a Jewish household who chooses not to believe in God or to observe a single <em>mitzvot</em> is still a Jew.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, what even is a Jew? Perhaps what makes a Jew is their genetic heritage&mdash;but converts can become Jews regardless of their genetic makeup. Maybe a Jew is simply somebody who observes a set of cultural practices, like eating matzo and lox&mdash;but matzo and lox are Ashkenazic customs, and Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews have their own, distinct sets of customs. The definition of a Jew gets muddier and muddier as you go!</p>
<h2 id="ethno-religions">Ethno-religions</h2>
<p>Here we come up against another limit of the Western worldview: the separation of the concepts of ethnicity, culture, and religion. Judaism is an ethno-religious group. Judaism is not <em>merely</em> an ethnic group, set of cultural practices, or religion. It is all three at once, with all three aspects being inextricable parts of the whole.</p>
<p>All Jews are descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (or descendants of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Judah, which is about as far back as we can historically verify). Many are genetic descendants. Many married into the family. Some were adopted into the family through conversion. Although world Jewry has been broken up and scattered across the world, developing into a number of distinct Diaspora cultures, we are all still family. The food we eat might have different flavors or colors, but we observe the <em>kashrut</em> laws. We pray the same prayers in the same ancestral tongue. We observe the same <em>Shabbat</em>, read the same Torah, and argue in the same Talmudic idiom. As many differences as there are between different Jewish communities, there are more similarities. In this way, Judaism can be thought of as an ethnic group whose cultural heritage includes a common religious practice. In other words, Judaism is an ethno-religion.</p>
<p>No wonder it&rsquo;s so much harder to convert to Judaism than many other religions! In order to become a Christian, one need only accept Jesus as the Christ and profess their faith. In order to convert to Islam, one need only profess their belief in Allah and the Prophet Muhammad. There are religious and cultural practices that one might be expected to adopt after conversion, but they are not crucial to religious identity.</p>
<p>Converting to Judaism, however, requires a period of study supervised by a Rabbi, and the approval of a Rabbinical Court (<em>beit din</em>). The <em>beit din</em> might ask about your beliefs, but they will ask much more about your understanding of Jewish history, ritual, culture, practice, etc. It&rsquo;s less like converting to a religion, and more like seeking citizenship in a new country.</p>
<p>Of course, Jewish identity has become increasingly more complicated since the establishment of the political State of Israel in 1948. A detailed discussion of Zionism and Israel is beyond the scope of the present essay. Various strands of Zionist thought have sought to replace Jewish religious identity with a secular, nationalist one, a strategy which the Israeli government has largely adopted. The Israeli government has also, in various ways, attempted to exercise control over Jewish religious life. Likewise, some religious sects have exerted disproportionate influence on Israeli policy. Discussion about Israel&rsquo;s role in Jewish life and identity has been ubiquitous, and sometimes heated, since the October 7th Hamas attack and Israel&rsquo;s military response; and, although the historical and political situation in the Levant is incredibly complicated, a sharp increase in global antisemitism and violent attacks against Diaspora Jews, has made taking a stance on Israel a matter of public safety for Diaspora communities.</p>
<p>Jewish identity, like all identities, is complicated. It is especially so when approached from a Western, predominantly Christian worldview. We live in an age when social media amplifies the most alarmist and vitriolic opinions and extremist populist movements are sweeping across the United States and Europe. I hope that this essay will serve to foster some understanding between Americans and the Jews among them.</p>
