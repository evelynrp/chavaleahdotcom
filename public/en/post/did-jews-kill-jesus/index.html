<span id="the-marginpar-0" class="marginpar" role="note">Accusations of deicide have followed Jews for millenia. We&rsquo;re going to get into the details, but let me say up front: please stop.</span>
As discussed above, there is no consensus over whether Jesus was a real historical figure. For the sake of answering this question, we will treat the Gospel narratives as being more or less reliable historical accounts, and analyze it in light of contemporary political forces.</p>
<h2 id="rapid-fire-recap-second-temple-politics">Rapid Fire Recap: Second Temple Politics</h2>
<p>The entire region was hotly contested because of its militarily and economically valuable location. The current regime, the Hasmonean Dynasty, came to power after a successful rebellion against the Hellenistic successors of Alexander the Great, and promptly made Judea into a Roman vassal state. Contemporary politics featured three major factions: the Pharisees, who emphasized obedience to the Law and personal responsibility; the Sadducees, who emphasized the Temple cult and engaged in politics to protect the interests of the Hasmonean priesthood; and the Zealots, who were guerilla military bands seeking independence from Rome.</p>
<h2 id="the-gospel-accounts">The Gospel Accounts</h2>
<p>Most readers are likely familiar with the Gospels&rsquo; accounts of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus is arrested, brought before the chief priests and accused, then brought before Pilate and tried, and then crucified. The Gospels generally give rather detailed accounts of these events. This is surprising, because, in all likelihood, none of these events took place!</p>

<div role="doc-epigraph" class="epigraph">
    <blockquote>
    Jesus was executed by crucifixion, which was a common method of torture and execution used by the Romans&hellip; So the execution of Jesus was a Roman affair, possibly with the cooperation of the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem. The Romans did not need to try a troublesome Jewish peasant in order to kill him. They tortured and crucified nameless lower-class people all the time. In order to get rid of Jesus, who had caused a disturbance in the temple, had made radical-sounding pronouncements and prophecies, and was rumored to have aspirations to kingship, the Romans would have simply taken him by force and crucified him the next day along with a few others they were getting rid of. There was no need for any trial, much less two or more before different &ldquo;courts.&rdquo; It would have been more trouble than a Roman governor needed for the desired result.

<p>However, it is against my training not to engage a literary text on its own terms, so let&rsquo;s examine the texts and allow them to speak for themselves.</p>
<h3 id="matthew">Matthew</h3>

<div role="doc-epigraph" class="epigraph">
    <blockquote>
    <p>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
<p>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest&rsquo;s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
<p>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
<p>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
<p>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>
<p>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
<p>But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</p>
<p>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
<p>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>
<p>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>

<span id="the-marginpar-3" class="marginpar" role="note">A full discussion of Jesus&rsquo;s answer, his use of the phrase &ldquo;Son of man&rdquo;, etc. is beyond the scope of the present work: for now, it will suffice to say that Jesus is likely referencing Daniel 7, which many of his contemporaries linked to the Messiah; that modern scholars are highly skeptical of such a connection; and that the phrase &ldquo;Son of man&rdquo; is literally a poetic epithet for &ldquo;human&rdquo; or &ldquo;earthling&rdquo;.</span>
This is Jesus&rsquo;s first trial, in which he is tried by the High Priest. Matthew asserts Jesus&rsquo;s innocence by stating that many false witnesses testified against him, but they still could not get any charges to stick. It is not until Jesus refuses to explicitly deny being the Messiah that the charge of blasphemy is finally levied against him.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</p>
<p>And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</p>
<p>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</p>
<p>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</p>
<p>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</p>
<p>Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</p>
<p>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</p>
<p>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</p>
<p>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</p>
<p>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</p>
<p>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</p>
<p>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</p>
<p>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</p>
<p>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</p>
<p>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</p>
<p>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</p>
<p>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</p>

This is Jesus&rsquo;s second trial, and the reason Jews tend to take the blame for killing Jesus. There is, of course, no substantial evidence of a historical <em>privilegium Paschale</em> which pardoned one prisoner during Passover. Putting that aside, however, we see that Matthew is rather explicit that it is not necessarily the will of the whole crowd to put Jesus to death. Rather, they are encited by the chief priests and elders. Anybody who has seen <em>Borat</em> is well aware of how easy it is to get a crowd to cheer for some pretty attrocious things, like drinking the blood of every man, woman, and child in Iraq.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</p>
<p>And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</p>
<p>And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</p>
<p>For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</p>
<p>And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</p>
<p>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</p>
<p>But neither so did their witness agree together.</p>
<p>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
<p>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</p>
<p>And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p>Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</p>
<p>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</p>
<p>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p>
<p>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p>
<p>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</p>
<p>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>
<p>Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p>
<p>And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>
<p>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</p>
<p>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p>
<p>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p>
<p>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
<p>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>
<p>And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>

    <blockquote>
</div>
<p>This is pretty much the same story, with a couple of key differences. First, Jesus does not deny being the Messiah. Second, the charges against Barabbas are made clear: insurrection and murder. This makes it likely that Barabbas is a Zealot.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</p>
<p>Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</p>
<p>And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</p>
<p>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
<p>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</p>
<p>And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</p>
<p>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</p>
<p>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>
<p>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>
<p>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
<p>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p>
<p>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod&rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
<p>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>
<p>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>
<p>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>
<p>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
<p>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p>
<p>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p>
<p>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p>
<p>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>
<p>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>
<p>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</p>
<p>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p>
<p>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</p>
<p>But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
<p>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</p>
<p>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p>
<p>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
<p>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
