<h1>Local IT Support</h1><p>Computers are confusing, and learning how to effectively set up and manage devices can take a long time. It doesn&rsquo;t help that everything from your doorbell to your car is computerized, and a lot of the resources out there use specialized jargon that&rsquo;s impossible to understand.</p>
<p>I offer IT Support services to friends and community members. I am a Google-certified IT Support Professional and have been CompTIA A+ certified.</p>
<p>Luckily, I grew up in the &ldquo;computer age&rdquo; and have been deploying, hardening, and maintaining my own fleet of devices for over a decade (since I was 12 years old!). Whatever you&rsquo;re having issues with, I&rsquo;m at least moderately well-prepared to deal with it!</p>
<h2 id="how-i-can-help">How I Can Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buying new computers or devices at a good price</li>
<li>Setting up new devices</li>
<li>Migrating from an old device to a new one</li>
<li>Smart appliances</li>
<li>Home automation</li>
<li>Virus prevention and recovery</li>
<li>Technological black magic and man-made horrors beyond your comprehension</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="money-talk">Money Talk</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do this for money, but because it&rsquo;s fun, I want to keep my skills sharp, and I want to give back to my community. That said, I don&rsquo;t charge for my services.</p>
<p><strong>This is a pay-what-you-want service.</strong></p>
<p>If I need to buy parts, I will charge you the <em>actual amount that I paid for them</em>.</p>
<p>I accept most forms of payment, including cash, card, and cryptocurrency.</p>
