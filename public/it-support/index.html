<p>I offer IT Support services to friends and community members.</p>
<p>I am a Google-certified IT Support Professional and have been CompTIA A+ certified. Computers are confusing, and learning how to effectively set up and manage devices can take a long time. It doesn&rsquo;t help that everything from your doorbell to your car is computerized, and a lot of the resources out there use specialized jargon that&rsquo;s impossible to understand.</p>
<p>Luckily, I grew up in the &ldquo;computer age&rdquo; and have been deploying, hardening, and maintaining my own fleet of devices for over a decade (since I was 12 years old!). Whatever you&rsquo;re having issues with, I&rsquo;m at least moderately well-prepared to deal with it!</p>
<h2 id="how-i-can-help">How I Can Help<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-i-can-help">#</a></h2>
<p>Here are some of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows &mdash; I&rsquo;ve done everything from installation to security hardening to automating software deployment and updates</li>
<li>Linux &mdash; all of the above, plus setting up drivers, udev rules, and printers; I&rsquo;m also familiar with cli tools and window managers (i3, bspwm, sway, hyprland); I have experience with Arch, Debian and derivatives, Fedora, Universal Blue, and a few niche distros like Chimera and Gentoo</li>

<li>Raspberry Pi &mdash; I have set up rpi&rsquo;s with pi-hole, AdGuard Home, and RetroPie</li>
<li>Self-hosted Services &mdash; I have hosted services like Plex, Jellyfin, Servarr</li>
<li>Security &mdash; I&rsquo;m experienced with password managers like LastPass, Bitwarden, Keepass, and <code>pass</code>, physical security keys like the YubiKey, OnlyKey, and SoloKey, firewalls, DNS sinkholes, and the like</li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t do this for money, but because it&rsquo;s fun, I want to keep my skills sharp, and I want to give back to my community. That said, I don&rsquo;t charge for my services.</p>
<p><strong>This is a pay-what-you-want service.</strong></p>
<p>If I need to buy parts, I will charge you the <em>actual amount that I paid for them</em>.</p>
