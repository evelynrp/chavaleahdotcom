So this is Judaism for not Jews.\nThis is class number one. Was it Gary who asked me this morning about, I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to convert you?\nRight. It\u0026rsquo;s just part of your religion to come out in the public and try to educate people.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t convert people. We do not do proselytization. The only reason I\u0026rsquo;m doing this is because around Easter time, we did that Passover potluck, and people seemed to have some interest in the concept of a Seder and, like, what do Jews do around this time? And then people brought bread and macaroni and pizza to the Passover potluck, and Passover is the festival of unleavened bread, and Jews are not allowed to eat bread or pasta or pizza. So I thought that was a little bit, um, almost like a faux pas, kind of, you know? But, of course, y\u0026rsquo;all didn\u0026rsquo;t know what Passover was or anything, so that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m doing this class.\nIf anyone has questions about anything at any point, stop me and ask them.\nThese are some of the questions that I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to answer today. So isn\u0026rsquo;t Judaism just Christianity without Jesus? What\u0026rsquo;s the difference? Like, isn\u0026rsquo;t the only real difference that Jews reject Christ? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it just Christianity with more rules? Like, what you can and can\u0026rsquo;t do? Like, eat bread during Passover. And what\u0026rsquo;s the deal with the Jews crucifying our Lord and Savior?\nRight, so to answer the Jesus questions, we should probably start with addressing whether or not Jesus was a real history guy, or just made up, I guess. Um, so this is a quote from the book, New Testament History and Literature. The New Testament contains contradictory historical accounts of various parts of early Christianity. The account of the birth of Jesus and the origins of his family provided by Matthew is totally different from that in Luke, and any harmonization cannot stand up to the standards of modern historiography. The different narratives of his resurrection appearances, who of his disciples claimed they had seen him, when and where, and Mark, Matthew, Luke, and Paul all contradict one another. The New Testament is simply not a reliable source for the history of Jesus or early Christianity when taken at face value.\nThis is a pretty common thing for ancient historical sources. They weren\u0026rsquo;t interested in hard facts the same way that we are. They were more interested in presenting an interpretation of history in order to convey the right message. So if a kid asks you, what\u0026rsquo;s electricity? How does electricity work? You might answer them, um, well, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s, there\u0026rsquo;s power in the walls, and the power goes through wires, and it makes machines work, because kids aren\u0026rsquo;t going to understand electricity is the flow of electrons, and, uh, electrons flow from a higher to a lower voltage in order to reach equilibrium, and all that nonsense, and probably most of us don\u0026rsquo;t really understand how electricity works either. So we present an interpretation of the facts in order to get a message across, and that is probably what the gospel authors were doing. And that\u0026rsquo;s why there are some contradictions between accounts.\nWell, isn\u0026rsquo;t it also because it was probably oral history and so forth? I mean, my brother and sister and I can get together and talk about something that happened 40 years ago. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean a different memory. So it could be partly part of it.\nYeah, the Bible is, it\u0026rsquo;s not univocal. It\u0026rsquo;s told by many voices. And so there\u0026rsquo;s always going to be some differences in how people remember things, how people choose to tell a story. But yeah, that does make it a little bit more difficult to nail down the historicity of the gospel accounts.\nOkay, so what archaeological evidence do we have for the existence of Jesus as a historical figure? This is the first pretty much not-gospel evidence that we have for Jesus. It\u0026rsquo;s called the Alexamenos graffiti, and scholars date it to around 200 CE. I am sure that you cannot make out any of this. So, here\u0026rsquo;s a sketch instead. We have a horse-headed man hanging on the cross with the inscription, Alexamenos worships his God. This is a sort of derogatory graffiti making fun of this Christian for worshiping a God who was executed in a brutal and humiliating way.\nSo, where was it found?\nSomewhere in the Roman Empire, but I believe the city of Rome itself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting that that\u0026rsquo;s a Roman cross. It\u0026rsquo;s not the cross that we have. It\u0026rsquo;s a T-shaped cross.\nYep. Yep. So, we know for sure that by 200 CE, there were some people going around worshiping a God who had been executed on a cross. They didn\u0026rsquo;t give us a name or anything for this God, unfortunately, but we can be pretty sure that it\u0026rsquo;s Jesus. We also have some non-Christian literary sources from the Jews in the Talmud. What is the Talmud? Who knows? What\u0026rsquo;s the Talmud?\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t know. We\u0026rsquo;re all in trouble. Is it an idol? Right?\nNot really.\nIs it a group of people? Are there the writings? Is the Talmud the writings? You have the prophets.\nOkay, so you\u0026rsquo;re getting at something sort of different. So, the Hebrew scriptures or the Old Testament is divided into three sections. The law, the prophets, and the writings. The law or the Torah is the first five books. The five books of Moses or the Pentateuch. Then you have the prophets, the Nevi\u0026rsquo;im, we call them in Hebrew. And that\u0026rsquo;s Isaiah and all those guys. And we have the writings, the Ketuvim. That\u0026rsquo;s everything else. So, the Psalms, Song of Songs, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, all that stuff. But that\u0026rsquo;s all in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament. Which we call the Tanakh, which is an acronym. Torah, Nevi\u0026rsquo;im, Ketuvim.\nAfter the Tanakh was sort of formalized, Jews kept on saying things and writing things. And we collected that into a volume called the Mishnah. And then they kept on saying things and commenting on the Mishnah. So, we compiled that into the Gemara, which is the commentary on the Mishnah. And the Mishnah and the Gemara together are called the Talmud. So, this was probably written down sometime after the Jews were kicked out of Israel the last time.\nSo, before Moses separated the Red Sea?\nLong, long after. Okay. Moses was, if he existed, probably a couple thousand years BCE. And this probably would have been around, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, 200 or so CE. Around the same time that the New Testament Gospels were being written down, we were writing down the Talmud.\nAnd so, that\u0026rsquo;s just everybody\u0026rsquo;s conversations and commentary on everybody else\u0026rsquo;s conversations.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s commentaries on commentaries on commentaries.\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s why the saying, like, you know, nine Jewish rabbis in a room, ten opinions.\nYeah, two Jews, three opinions. There\u0026rsquo;s actually a funny story. The Old Testament translation that Jesus had was called the Septuagint. It was a translation of the Hebrew into Aramaic, which was kind of the lingua franca of the time. All the Greeks, the Greek Jews spoke Aramaic. And it was considered at the time to be a miracle. Because the Greek authorities got, like, 70 rabbis in a room together. No, they got, they put 70 rabbis in 70 different rooms. And they weren\u0026rsquo;t allowed to communicate. And they all came up with the same Aramaic translation. But the Jews said, if you want a real miracle, put them all in the same room.\nSo, this is a story from the Talmud that might be talking about Jesus of Nazareth. And it goes like, so. So, on Passover Eve, they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for 40 days, publicly proclaiming, Jesus the Nazarene is going to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him. And so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover Eve. Ulla said, how can you understand this proof? Was Jesus the Nazarene worthy of conducting a search for a reason to acquit him? He was an insider to idol worship. And the merciful one states with regard to an insider to idol worship, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him. Rather, Jesus was different as he had close ties with the government and the Gentile authorities were interested in his acquittal. So, consequently, the court gave him every opportunity to clear himself so that it could not be claimed that he was falsely convicted.\nWhat the heck is going on here? So this story is really about due process in Jewish law. There is this guy called Jesus the Nazarene, and the Jews are going to execute him for practicing sorcery and inciting the Jews to idol worship. And it describes a sort of due process that the Jews give to Jesus the Nazarene where they have a guy go out and say, hey, this guy is on trial. He\u0026rsquo;s about to be executed. Anyone who has evidence to help him should definitely come forward before he dies. And this rabbi, Ulla, is saying, why did we do this? Inciters to idol worship are not supposed to get any sort of due process. We\u0026rsquo;re supposed to just kill them according to our law. So what\u0026rsquo;s the deal?\nAnd the answer is, Jesus was very close to the Gentile authorities, the Roman government. So if we just killed him, that would look bad for us, and we might get in trouble with the Romans. So that\u0026rsquo;s why we had a crier go out ahead of time. This does not sound like the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion. I mean, the Jews hang him on Passover Eve. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense because Jesus was crucified after Passover. Jesus was not that close to the Gentile authorities, considering\u0026hellip;\nThey didn\u0026rsquo;t like him.\nThey nailed him to a cross, etc., etc.\nSo, what do we do with this? Is this evidence of Jesus or not? We don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another Talmudic story about someone named Jesus.\nWhat is the word on top?\nThis is the book of the Talmud that it comes from, and this is the page that it\u0026rsquo;s on. So, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like Matthew 7:9, something like that.\nWas Sanhedrin a person?\nThe Sanhedrin is the Jewish court, so this is the volume of the Talmud that deals with the discussions upon discussions about the Jewish court, and most of it has nothing to do with the Sanhedrin, actually. But that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another time.\nYehoshua ben Prechaia said, How beautiful is this inn? Jesus, his students, said to him, But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper\u0026rsquo;s wife are narrow. Yehoshua said to him, Look in one! Do not involve yourself with regard to that manner, the appearance of a married woman. So he produced 400 shoferot and ostracized him.\nSo these guys, Yehoshua and his student Jesus, go to an inn. Yehoshua says, This inn is awesome. And Jesus says, Yeah, and the innkeeper\u0026rsquo;s wife is kind of a looker, right?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what eyes are narrow means?\nYeah, she looks like a bit of a loose woman.\nI\u0026rsquo;m like, my eyes are narrow.\nSo Yehoshua says, What are you doing commenting on the appearance of a married woman? Get out of here, you\u0026rsquo;re ostracized. We shun you.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s 400 shofar?\nA shofar is the horn that we blow at certain ritual occasions. So he gets 400 people who blow shofar to officially ostracize him from the Jewish community. And everybody knows it because we had 400 shofar announce it.\nSo he\u0026rsquo;s kicked out.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s pretty much kicked out for this. Excluded from the community.\nSo maybe we should just say that Jesus is a very common name.\nThat is true.\nThis could be anybody\u0026rsquo;s guess who this person is.\nJesus came before Yehoshua several times and said to him, Accept my repentance. Yehoshua took no notice of him. One day Yehoshua was reciting the Shema, the central prayer in Judaism, one of them. And Jesus came before him with the same request. Yehoshua intended to accept his request and signaled him with his hand to wait until he completed his prayer. It\u0026rsquo;s against Jewish law to interrupt the Shema. Because it\u0026rsquo;s very important. So Jesus approaches him while he\u0026rsquo;s reciting and he says, Hold on a second. But Jesus didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the signal and thought, He\u0026rsquo;s driving me away. So he went and stood a brick upright to serve as an idol and bowed down to it. Yehoshua then said to Jesus, Repent! And Jesus said to him, This is the tradition that I received from you. Whoever sins and causes the masses to sin is not given the opportunity to repent. And the master says, Jesus performed sorcery inside of the Jews to engage in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\nJews today use this story as an example of how not to treat people. Often we will say that this was Jesus Jesus. Even if the facts don\u0026rsquo;t quite line up. And we\u0026rsquo;ll say that Jesus went off and started his own religion because one of our rabbis was a jerk and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take his repentance. And that\u0026rsquo;s what Jesus says here when he says, Yehoshua says repent, and Jesus says, Look, I learned from you that even if I try to repent, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to accept it. So why should I even bother with you anymore? You\u0026rsquo;re a jerk. But is this the Jesus of the New Testament? I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nSo, Evelyn, in this prayer that you just said, they say, Lord. Who is the Lord that they\u0026rsquo;re talking about?\nThe word there in the Hebrew is the Tetragrammaton, Yad-Heh-Vav-Heh. This is the name that God gave to Moses at the burning bush to identify himself. But we don\u0026rsquo;t say that name, so we use a substitution, Adonai, and that\u0026rsquo;s generally translated as Lord.\nSo, in the Jewish religion, we believe in God, but not Jesus, as our Savior.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s pretty much what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to answer. We don\u0026rsquo;t accept him as the Messiah, but we\u0026rsquo;re also not really sure if he was even a real historical guy or if the Gospel accounts happened as they\u0026rsquo;re written or, you know. And why do we not accept Jesus? What do we really think about him? Well, to answer that, I will pose to you a question. Who do you prefer, Rabbi Hillel or Rabbi Shammai?\nDon\u0026rsquo;t know the dude.\nYeah, you don\u0026rsquo;t know the dude. We don\u0026rsquo;t really think about Jesus that much, honestly. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a sort of misconception that Jews just really are against Jesus, but kind of just don\u0026rsquo;t care. I personally think that Jesus, as he\u0026rsquo;s presented in the Gospels, was a brilliant, radical reformer, and that the Jews could probably listen to him here and there. But the whole, like, Messiah, Son of God thing, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit odd.\nSo Jews don\u0026rsquo;t believe in the Holy Trinity. Where does the Holy Spirit come in here?\nWhat Holy Spirit? I mean, everybody has the breath of God within them.\nAre you going to, at some point, because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get in the way of your narrative, but are you going to talk about some of the differences, like the differences in terms of belief in an eternal life, or that sort of thing?\nWas I going to? Maybe, maybe not.\nWrite it down, add it to your list.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s Hillel and Shammai. You don\u0026rsquo;t know who they are? Why do you care? Yeah.\nHillel founded a society. The Hillel Society.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think he founded that. He did invent the sandwich, allegedly.\nI do want to address this question, though. Differences in belief like the afterlife and such. Afterlife is a tricky question, because it\u0026rsquo;s not directly addressed in the Tanakh, the Hebrew scriptures. So in the Tanakh, the closest that we get to is a place called Sheol. Translates to grave, described as a dark, watery place underground. So according to the Tanakh, when you die, you get buried. And that\u0026rsquo;s about as far as we get. After the Tanakh, we have come up with various different theories. One of them is the idea of the world to come. This is pretty analogous to what Jesus would have called the kingdom of God. Some sort of utopian future in which things will not suck. And maybe some of us will come back to life. Maybe some of us won\u0026rsquo;t. Some people believed in the resurrection. Some didn\u0026rsquo;t. The Apostle Paul actually manages to escape from persecution once by bringing up bodily resurrection. And then all the Jews start arguing with each other and he kind of just slips away. Some Jews today believe in reincarnation. There\u0026rsquo;s no real agreement.\nWho were these people?\nHillel and Shammai were two very popular rabbis back in the day.\nWhat day?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know. Nobody knows, the mythical time of when we tell stories about the sages. No one knows. But they, yes?\nThe question is, the Gospels were written like, say, a hundred years or so after the death of Jesus.\nYes.\nNow, when was this written and stuff? I mean, is everything just open to interpretations from who\u0026rsquo;s ever writing whatever, you know?\nThe Talmud was probably written about the same time as the Gospels.\nSo everything takes place hundreds of years after the fact. So it\u0026rsquo;s just whatever the people, you know, oh, well, so-and-so said this or that. And they don\u0026rsquo;t actually know. I mean.\nWhatever message that they\u0026rsquo;re trying to get across is what they write down.\nThey didn\u0026rsquo;t have cell phones to them. And the internet.\nAnd most people were not very literate, so they couldn\u0026rsquo;t have written things down. Right. We think that Paul was illiterate and dictated all his letters. Actually, I think we know that for sure because he says in the preamble to the letters, I\u0026rsquo;m Paul, and this was written down by so-and-so. But yeah, Hillel and Shammai had two competing schools of thought, and Hillel won pretty much every single argument. And we only remember Shammai as a loser.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve accepted that we can\u0026rsquo;t know for sure if Jesus was real or not. Plenty of people are willing to just say, yeah, he probably did. What was Jesus\u0026rsquo;s relationship with Jews? So to understand that, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go through what did Judaism look like in Jesus\u0026rsquo;s day? So Jesus was around during the tecond temple. The first temple was destroyed many long time ago. And then the Jews came back to Israel after some time away, built a second temple. And that\u0026rsquo;s where Jesus is going all the time whenever he goes to Jerusalem.\nWe have three main factions, the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Zealots. You might recognize some of these guys from many of the Jesus stories. So the Sadducees are the priestly class. They run the temple. They\u0026rsquo;re in charge of the temple sacrifices. They got into power because of a revolt earlier when they kicked the Greeks out of the temple. So they kind of have some political status. And they work together with the Romans because they have political status. They want the Romans to not take that away from them. They\u0026rsquo;re very interested in maintaining the status quo.\nThe Pharisees are a faction that came out of the exile in between the first and second temple. So Judaism was pretty centered around the temple until the exile when the temple was destroyed. And they couldn\u0026rsquo;t really do temple stuff anymore. So they had to figure out, how do we stay Jews in exile? So they invented this form of portable Judaism that was less focused on the temple rituals and more focused on the Torah, obeying the commands, personal piety. This resulted in a decentralization of practice. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have to necessarily rely on the temple. And they are a separatist faction because they\u0026rsquo;re so focused on the law, they sort of isolate themselves. They don\u0026rsquo;t hang out with non-Pharisees very much. They definitely will not eat at the same table as a Gentile because who knows what Gentiles are eating. It might not be kosher. They might be praying to idols at that table, et cetera.\nAnd then the Zealots are the anti-Roman guerrilla fighters. They lived up in the Judean hill country and would just get together and go attack some Romans every now and then.\nWhen would this have been?\nThis would have been around the time of Jesus, probably around, I think we\u0026rsquo;re talking 20 CE. The second temple was destroyed in the year 70. So around 0 to 70-ish CE.\nWas there a connection between the Zealots and Masada?\nWho?\nMasada, the fortification that the Romans took.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t read my Josephus enough, so I\u0026rsquo;m not\u0026hellip;\nWhen you talk about the second temple, were those described as big temples in Jerusalem? Is this one like the\u0026hellip;\nYes.\nLike the golden one?\nSo the first temple that I refer to is the Temple of Solomon. It\u0026rsquo;s the central location of Jewish worship from the time of Solomon throughout the whole Old Testament, basically. Solomon is described to have built an enormous temple with a lot of gold and a lot of stuff. And then the Babylonians come in and knock that down. And a while later, the Persians say, you\u0026rsquo;re allowed to go back and build a new one. It\u0026rsquo;s not quite as impressive as the first one. And the people who remember the first one start crying because it\u0026rsquo;s so lame compared to what they remember. And then the Romans knocked that one down, and now there\u0026rsquo;s no temple.\nOkay. So it\u0026rsquo;s the one temple.\nYes. One temple.\nOkay.\nUnless you\u0026rsquo;re a Samaritan because they had a different temple, but that\u0026rsquo;s a whole other conversation. Any other questions?\nSo this is way before they did the Golden Dome? Temple?\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a Muslim temple. The Al-Aqsa Mosque. Yeah.\nMy bad.\nWhat was Jesus\u0026rsquo; relationship to all these guys? We can probably guess that the Pharisees and Sadducees weren\u0026rsquo;t too fond of him if you\u0026rsquo;ve read your Gospels because they\u0026rsquo;re always trying to trick him into saying silly things. So let\u0026rsquo;s start with some stories.\nThen they came to Jerusalem, and he, Jesus, entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves, and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. He was teaching and saying, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers. And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it, they kept looking for a way to kill him, for they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching.\nIt makes sense.\nIt does make sense. We\u0026rsquo;re probably talking about the Sadducees here because it\u0026rsquo;s the temple, and the Sadducees control the temple cult. And they are being, Judy mentioned them earlier today, saying that they\u0026rsquo;re charging for money conversion. They\u0026rsquo;re charging for the sacrifices that you have to make. They\u0026rsquo;re not optional. They are mandatory. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s skimming off the top. And Jesus is not okay with the Sadducees profiting off of mandatory religious ritual. So he thinks that everyone should be able to participate in temple sacrifice, whether they can afford to or not. So he comes in and says, You guys are a bunch of jerks. I\u0026rsquo;m flipping your tables. So there\u0026rsquo;s clearly bad blood between Jesus and the Sadducees.\nNext we have Jesus and the Pharisees. And as Jesus sat at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with Jesus and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, he said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners? But when he heard this, he said, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means. I desire mercy, not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners. So we talked earlier about how Pharisees won\u0026rsquo;t eat with non-Pharisees because they\u0026rsquo;re worried about becoming ritually impure or accidentally eating non-kosher food, food that might have been sacrificed to idols. So they see Jesus eating with these people, tax collectors and sinners. I always think it\u0026rsquo;s funny that tax collectors are lumped in. The historical reason for that is that tax collectors worked with and for the Romans, and they usually would not take Jewish law very seriously. They were pretty assimilated to Roman culture. They were considered, like, traitors. Okay, so the Pharisees are very focused on the law, the book of the law. But Jesus here is quoting from the prophets, like Isaiah, in which God says, Your sacrifices are meaningless to me. Your festivals are repugnant. The sacrifice that I want is for you to take care of the poor, the widow, and the orphan. Jesus took this message to heart and preached it quite regularly. And so he\u0026rsquo;s kind of calling the Pharisees out for being very hoity-toity, but not actually doing anything useful that is actually helping anybody.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got quite a few of them people in our society now, and Jesus needs to come and talk to them again. That\u0026rsquo;s an understatement.\nYeah.\nAnd we have a story that deals a little bit with his relationship with the zealots. Then they, meaning the authorities, the Jewish authorities, sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said. And they came and said to him, Teacher, we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one, for you do not regard people with partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or should we not? But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, Why are you putting me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me see it. And they brought one. And he said to them, Whose head is this and whose title? They answered, Caesar\u0026rsquo;s. Jesus said to them, Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u0026rsquo;s and to God the things that are God\u0026rsquo;s. They were utterly amazed at him. So they\u0026rsquo;re trying to catch him in a trap where if he says, Yes, we should pay our taxes, then he\u0026rsquo;s a Roman shill. And if he says, No, we should not pay our taxes, then they can get him in trouble with the Roman government. So either way, he\u0026rsquo;s between a rock and a hard place. But he pulls this maneuver where he says, Look, it\u0026rsquo;s George Washington\u0026rsquo;s face on the quarter. God doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about this. The money is already his. Just give it back to him. So he\u0026rsquo;s clearly rejecting the sort of militaristic, anti-Roman position of the Zealots.\nWhat are the Herodians?\nHerodians, they\u0026rsquo;re the faction of King Herod, who was put into power after the Maccabean Revolt, which was the same revolt that put the Sadducees in power. So he\u0026rsquo;s pretty much referring to the Sadducees in a roundabout way.\nSo people higher up.\nYes. So Jesus had strong words for everybody. He was very radical, very interested in reforming the Jewish community into something better.\nAre the Jews responsible for killing Jesus? This has been a thing that Jews have had to deal with for the last 2,000 years, being called the Christ killers. According to this book, Jesus was executed by a crucifixion, which was a common method of torture and execution used by the Romans. So the execution of Jesus was a Roman affair, possibly with the cooperation of Jewish leadership in Jerusalem. The Romans did not need to try a troublesome Jewish peasant in order to kill him. They tortured and crucified nameless lower class people all the time in order to get rid of Jesus, who had caused a disturbance in the temple, had made radical sounding pronouncements and prophecies, and was rumored to have aspirations to kingship. The Romans would have simply taken him by force and crucified him the next day, along with a few others they were getting rid of. There was no need for any trial, much less two or more before different courts would have been more trouble than a Roman government needed for the desired result.\nSo the gospel narratives are a little bit confusing in the context of the actual political reality of the time. It seems like all the rigmarole was completely unnecessary. But I like to take literature seriously anyways. So if we read the gospel accounts and what they say, we can just say that they happen pretty much the way that they\u0026rsquo;re written down and still get some information out of them.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a few threads common to all of the gospel accounts. Some differences, but there are some commonalities. First one is that in all of the accounts, Jesus is captured by the Romans in collaboration with the Sadducees because he is a threat to their power and the institutions, political institutions that they\u0026rsquo;re a part of. He is directly flipping over their tables and such and calling for reform, trying to take away their sources of revenue.\nDoes anyone know who Barabbas is?\nIt was the alternative.\nYes. Yes. Yes. In the Gospel accounts, when Jesus is brought before Pilate, the governor of Judea, apparently there is a tradition around Passover when the governor would pardon one criminal, whoever the Jews chose. This is an outrageous tradition. There\u0026rsquo;s no way this happened. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like Prima Nocta and Braveheart, if you\u0026rsquo;ve seen that. It\u0026rsquo;s very good storytelling, but it probably didn\u0026rsquo;t happen.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s Jesus and there\u0026rsquo;s Barabbas, who is the other criminal. He\u0026rsquo;s described as a murderer and a seditionist. And the Jews say, we want Barabbas. Free that guy.\nBarabbas is not a real name. It\u0026rsquo;s Aramaic. Bar-Abbas, son of the father, which is completely meaningless. It basically just means a person. We can contrast that with the name that Jesus used for himself, son of man, which is completely meaningless and basically just means a person. So the gospel narratives are creating this dichotomy between Jesus and Barabbas, who are, their names are meant to be similar, to call our attention to them. Jesus is this peace-loving pacifist. He is submitting himself to execution. The Gospel of John says, I could free myself if I wanted. I could have my followers storm this place and free me, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do that because my kingdom is a kingdom of peace. It\u0026rsquo;s a kingdom of the last coming first, the mighty being brought low.\nMeanwhile, Barabbas is an insurrectionist and a murderer. He\u0026rsquo;s one of the zealots probably going around trying to gain Jewish independence from Rome by violent means. So the story is saying the Jews chose violence rather than the way of peace that Jesus was teaching. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s probably the message that the Jews of the first century would have heard.\nSo, yeah. We also know that Jesus was a victim of sort of a mob mentality in all of the Gospel accounts. It\u0026rsquo;s the Sadducees who start up the crucified Jesus chants and everybody kind of just goes along. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if anyone here has seen the movie Borat. But if you have, you\u0026rsquo;ve seen Sacha Baron Cohen pretending to be a foreigner going up and saying things like, we support your war of terror. We support killing every single man, woman, and child in Iraq. And all the people start cheering and going along with it. So it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to get a mob to agree with almost anything.\nAnd again, Roman execution, the historicity of whether or not the Jews were allowed to administer capital punishment is in question. But according to the gospel narratives, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t, and that\u0026rsquo;s why they had to bring him to the Romans. But pretty clearly\u0026hellip;\nOkay, so how is Judaism different from Christianity? Jews are more focused on action than belief. Nobody cares really if a Jew believes in God or not. There are a ton of atheist Jews who are still Jewish and still very accepted as Jews. What we care about is being a good person, obeying the laws maybe. Depending on what that means to you, there are a lot of different positions. I think for Christians, mostly there is a lot more emphasis on belief. You are expected to believe in Jesus, believe in the resurrection. There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of creeds like the Apostles\u0026rsquo; Creed, the Nicene Creed. You might know of those. Many, many Christians were burned at the stake by Christian authorities for having some heretical beliefs. Judy would have been burned at the stake if she was a believer.\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have lasted long. That\u0026rsquo;s great.\nChristianity is generally considered to be a pretty individual affair. It\u0026rsquo;s between you and Jesus. Judaism is a group activity. You cannot be Jewish by yourself.\nSay what?\nYou cannot be Jewish by yourself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s cultural.\nJews cannot pray alone, most of the prayers. You\u0026rsquo;re required to pray in a minyan, which is often translated as a quorum, which is traditionally a group of ten adult Jewish men. Today, we will usually let women be part of the dominion.\nThanks.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re not allowed to do mourning practices by yourself. If your mom or dad dies, you have to pray the mourning prayers in a minyan. You\u0026rsquo;re not allowed to practice that in isolation.\nSo, you have to go to the temple?\nYes. Yeah.\nCurrently?\nCurrently. We don\u0026rsquo;t have a temple temple anymore. So, you\u0026rsquo;d have to find like your local synagogue, which sometimes we will call a temple. A better translation would be a house of prayer. So, yeah.\nYou can pray at homes or does it have to be at the synagogue?\nIt can be anywhere as long as you have a minyan.\nOf mostly men.\nDepends on how orthodox you are.\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s my question. So, when you say more focused on action than belief, what would an Orthodox rabbi say? Think of that bullet point. Would they agree with you? An Orthodox is stricter? Just so I know what you\u0026rsquo;re\u0026hellip; I just want to clarify. Versus Reform.\nRight. There\u0026rsquo;s three major branches of Judaism today in America. We have the Modern Orthodox, the Conservative, and the Reform. I won\u0026rsquo;t get too much into the history, but they all have different positions about the Jewish law, and that\u0026rsquo;s the key differentiation. So, is Jewish law binding? Are we required to follow Jewish law? And, can Jewish law change over time? Are we allowed to reinterpret the law in response to our changing times?\nSo, the Modern Orthodox basically say, yes, Jewish law is binding, and no, it does not change. So, they are very conservative, very much sticks in the mud. The Conservative movement is kind of a middle ground. Yes, the law is binding. You have to follow the law, but we can change it in response to our evolving understanding of humanity and society. Reform are very loosey-goosey. The law is not binding. It\u0026rsquo;s more of a suggestion, and it\u0026rsquo;s subject to change. We can adapt it.\nSo, the Modern Orthodox would still agree that action is much more important than belief. But they might think that a lot of the, for example, atheist Jews are crazy.\nSo, that would be under the last cow. The crazies? The crazy people. You\u0026rsquo;re just saying Reform.\nYeah. They\u0026rsquo;d probably be considered more Reform, but I, yeah. Yes?\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on the word action. So, when you say an Orthodox would still believe that action is more important than belief, what\u0026rsquo;s, is that action like, like following the rituals?\nYeah. For the Orthodox, it would primarily be doing the three daily prayers, keeping kosher, making sure that you don\u0026rsquo;t touch dead bodies or lizards or whatever.\nBut not on good works.\nNot so much for the Orthodox, but the further you get to the right of this chart, the less that they\u0026rsquo;re worried about the sort of traditional laws and the more that they\u0026rsquo;re worried about the more social justice part of it, the prophetic, I don\u0026rsquo;t care about your fasts, help the poor.\nClothing, clothing and hair.\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s more on this side, the clothing requirements.\nThis just is reminding me of Christianity today with the extreme conservative fundamentalists who would have stormed out of here when you said anything at all about whether Jesus existed or not because the Bible is inerrant, infallible and has no contradictions in it. I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s their position and so the law is everything and your belief is everything. But on the other side, it would be like the UCC for sure and the Presbyterians to a degree that we\u0026rsquo;re going to put social justice and human needs first. So would you say we\u0026rsquo;re more Reform? Sure. As Christians, oh yeah, because the folks on the left, on this chart that is, don\u0026rsquo;t even think that progressive Christians are Christians at all. They think we\u0026rsquo;re going to hell because we don\u0026rsquo;t believe the way they believe. They\u0026rsquo;re very rigid and that\u0026rsquo;s who\u0026rsquo;s in power right now. That mindset is the powerful mindset in our country.\nIn fact, the Modern Orthodox wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even consider me Jewish because I had Conservative conversion and that is not strict enough for them.\nBless you. So are there different synagogues with these different, you can be a Conservative synagogue or you can be a Reform.\nFor the most part, a Jew is a Jew and you can go to wherever you want. This is more at like an institutional level of, you know, there\u0026rsquo;s like a bunch of rabbis in a building somewhere making rules and publishing books and stuff but most everyday Jews just don\u0026rsquo;t really care that much and will go to whatever synagogue is closest.\nSo if you walk to synagogue, does that mean you\u0026rsquo;re at least a Conservative? Would the Reformed Jews consider that this idea of not doing work, not starting your car, would they go for that or is that a Conservative Jew?\nThe car issue is not really a work issue. It\u0026rsquo;s about kindling fire on the Sabbath or carrying on the Sabbath which are two other prohibitions that you\u0026rsquo;re not allowed to do those things on the Sabbath. Modern Orthodox, you definitely are not allowed to drive a car. The leaders of the Conservative movement made a ruling some years ago that it\u0026rsquo;s better for you to go to synagogue than not. So if you must drive to get to synagogue then you can but you probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be driving anywhere else.\nThat kind of sounds like an Amish people. So with not using the power, the energy that is only on Sabbath.\nElectric cars are fine.\nReally?\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s kindling fire that is prohibited.\nSo the spark flag or the\u0026hellip;\nYeah, internal combustion engines are all\u0026hellip;\nBut without using lights in the house, isn\u0026rsquo;t that considered by the Orthodox\u0026hellip;\nModern Orthodox, for some reason, have decided that electricity is fire. Yes. Nobody else agrees.\nOkay. Weird.\nYeah. Yeah.\nSo you can go back to what you were saying.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what I was saying. What was I saying?\nAlright, so traditionally Judaism is transmitted by the mother. So if your mom is Jewish then you\u0026rsquo;re automatically Jewish. Different positions on this now. Most people will say that if either of your parents was Jewish and you were exposed to Judaism growing up then you count. Converting to\u0026hellip; Yes.\nCan I ask a question?\nYes.\nOkay, so my grandfather was Jewish and my grandmother wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nMm-hmm.\nDoes that affect my grandfather\u0026rsquo;s Judaism or\u0026hellip;\nIs the question does marrying a non-Jew make him less Jewish? '\nDoes he\u0026hellip; He stays Jewish, right?\nYes.\nOkay. You know\u0026hellip;\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t stop being Jewish.\nOkay. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t convert to another religion?\nI could, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop being a Jew. I would just be an apostate.\nA non-Jew not a person or an apostate? Is that a Christian or Christian Jews or some Christian Jews?\nYeah, there are. Yeah. Yeah. There are a lot of Buddhist Jews. A whole lot of Buddhist Jews. We call them Jubus. But don\u0026rsquo;t repeat that. That\u0026rsquo;s our word.\nSo, converting to Judaism is quite different than Christianity. Especially, for some reason, like, the more conservative Christian, the easier it is to become Christian. like, you just pray the prayer, like, I accept Jesus into my heart and boom, you\u0026rsquo;re Christian. For Judaism, if anybody remembers the, what is it called, confirmation classes, that kind of stuff, it\u0026rsquo;s sort of like that. We generally have to spend at least a year studying Judaism, learning all the laws and the traditions and the practices and the customs and the history. So it\u0026rsquo;s more like trying to get citizenship in a new country where you have to live in the country for a while and then you have to take an exam. When I converted, I had to sit in front of a Jewish court of three rabbis and they asked me questions and I had to prove that I knew what I was talking about and I\u0026rsquo;m sincere, before I was allowed.\nNo pressure.\nOh, there was a lot of pressure. I babbled like an idiot.\nWithout being a smart aleck, right?\nI was still a smart aleck.\nDo you read Hebrew? Is that a requirement?\nReading Hebrew is a requirement for the Modern Orthodox. I cannot read Hebrew. I can sort of sound things out a little bit but a lot of the letters look the same and the vowels are really hard to figure out. But that\u0026rsquo;s the end of my slides.\nOkay, there. That was perfect. That\u0026rsquo;s very nice. Very good. Thank you. Yeah. That was interesting. I missed a lot of it. Thank you.\nYay.\nThank you. Thank you.\nNext time, I think I will focus more on some of the common Jewish practices like what is Jewish prayer like? What\u0026rsquo;s the deal with the funny hats and the clothes and stuff?\nOh, yeah. That kind of thing.\nMm-hmm. That kind of thing. So\u0026hellip; Thank you.\n","permalink":"https://evelynpark.com/posts/judaism-for-gentiles-lecture-1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"video\"\u003eVideo\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n      \u003ciframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen\" loading=\"eager\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_NzpNWVOcj4?autoplay=0\u0026amp;controls=1\u0026amp;end=0\u0026amp;loop=0\u0026amp;mute=0\u0026amp;start=0\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" title=\"YouTube video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"transcript\"\u003eTranscript\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe transcript was generated by a tool, so it may not be 100% accurate.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so, Gary asked the first question, what is a Gentile?

For the sake of answering this question, we will treat the Gospel narratives as being more or less reliable historical accounts, and analyze it in light of contemporary political forces.\nRapid Fire Recap: Second Temple Politics The entire region was hotly contested because of its militarily and economically valuable location. The current regime, the Hasmonean Dynasty, came to power after a successful rebellion against the Hellenistic successors of Alexander the Great, and promptly made Judea into a Roman vassal state. Contemporary politics featured three major factions: the Pharisees, who emphasized obedience to the Law and personal responsibility; the Sadducees, who emphasized the Temple cult and engaged in politics to protect the interests of the Hasmonean priesthood; and the Zealots, who were guerilla military bands seeking independence from Rome.\nThe Gospel Accounts Most readers are likely familiar with the Gospels\u0026rsquo; accounts of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus is arrested, brought before the chief priests and accused, then brought before Pilate and tried, and then crucified. The Gospels generally give rather detailed accounts of these events. This is surprising, because, in all likelihood, none of these events took place!\nJesus was executed by crucifixion, which was a common method of torture and execution used by the Romans\u0026hellip; So the execution of Jesus was a Roman affair, possibly with the cooperation of the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem. The Romans did not need to try a troublesome Jewish peasant in order to kill him. They tortured and crucified nameless lower-class people all the time. In order to get rid of Jesus, who had caused a disturbance in the temple, had made radical-sounding pronouncements and prophecies, and was rumored to have aspirations to kingship, the Romans would have simply taken him by force and crucified him the next day along with a few others they were getting rid of. There was no need for any trial, much less two or more before different \u0026ldquo;courts.\u0026rdquo; It would have been more trouble than a Roman governor needed for the desired result.\n— Martin, 2012\nHowever, it is against my training not to engage a literary text on its own terms, so let\u0026rsquo;s examine the texts and allow them to speak for themselves.\nMatthew And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.\nBut Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest\u0026rsquo;s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.\nNow the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;\nBut found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,\nAnd said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.\nAnd the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?\nBut Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.\nJesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\nThen the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.\nWhat think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.\nThen did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,\nSaying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?\n— Matt 26:57-68, KJV\nThis is Jesus\u0026rsquo;s first trial, in which he is tried by the High Priest. Matthew asserts Jesus\u0026rsquo;s innocence by stating that many false witnesses testified against him, but they still could not get any charges to stick. It is not until Jesus refuses to explicitly deny being the Messiah that the charge of blasphemy is finally levied against him. (A full discussion of Jesus\u0026rsquo;s answer, his use of the phrase \u0026ldquo;Son of man\u0026rdquo;, etc. is beyond the scope of the present work: for now, it will suffice to say that Jesus is likely referencing Daniel 7, which many of his contemporaries linked to the Messiah; that modern scholars are highly skeptical of such a connection; and that the phrase \u0026ldquo;Son of man\u0026rdquo; is literally a poetic epithet for \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;earthling\u0026rdquo;.)\nWhen the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:\nAnd when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.\n\u0026hellip;\nAnd Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.\nAnd when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.\nThen said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?\nAnd he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.\nNow at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.\nAnd they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.\nTherefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?\nFor he knew that for envy they had delivered him.\nWhen he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.\nBut the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.\nThe governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.\nPilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.\nAnd the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.\nWhen Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.\nThen answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.\nThen released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.\n— Matthew 27:1-2, 11-26, KJV\nThis is Jesus\u0026rsquo;s second trial, and the reason Jews tend to take the blame for killing Jesus. There is, of course, no substantial evidence of a historical privilegium Paschale which pardoned one prisoner during Passover. Putting that aside, however, we see that Matthew is rather explicit that it is not necessarily the will of the whole crowd to put Jesus to death. Rather, they are encited by the chief priests and elders. Anybody who has seen Borat is well aware of how easy it is to get a crowd to cheer for some pretty attrocious things, like drinking the blood of every man, woman, and child in Iraq (Charles, 2006).\nMark And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.\nAnd Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.\nAnd the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.\nFor many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.\nAnd there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,\nWe heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.\nBut neither so did their witness agree together.\nAnd the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?\nBut he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\nAnd Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\nThen the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?\nYe have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.\nAnd some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.\n\u0026hellip;\nAnd straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.\nAnd Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.\nAnd the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.\nAnd Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.\nBut Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.\nNow at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.\nAnd there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.\nAnd the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.\nBut Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?\nFor he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.\nBut the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.\nAnd Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?\nAnd they cried out again, Crucify him.\nThen Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.\nAnd so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.\n— Mark 14:53-65, 15:1-15, KJV\nThis is pretty much the same story, with a couple of key differences. First, Jesus does not deny being the Messiah. Second, the charges against Barabbas are made clear: insurrection and murder. This makes it likely that Barabbas is a Zealot.\nLuke And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,\nArt thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:\nAnd if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.\nHereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.\nThen said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.\nAnd they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.\nAnd the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.\nAnd they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.\nAnd Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.\nThen said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.\nAnd they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.\nWhen Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.\nAnd as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod\u0026rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.\nAnd when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.\nThen he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.\nAnd the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.\nAnd Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.\nAnd the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.\nAnd Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,\nSaid unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:\nNo, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.\nI will therefore chastise him, and release him.\n(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)\nAnd they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:\n(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)\nPilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.\nBut they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.\nAnd he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.\nAnd they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.\nAnd Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.\nAnd he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.\n— Luke 22:66-71, 23:1-25, KJV\nIn Luke\u0026rsquo;s account, Jesus does not call himself the Messiah. Luke does corroborate Barabbas\u0026rsquo;s status as a rebel of some sort, guilty of sedition and murder. Shockingly, Luke adds a third trial with King Herod between the other two!\nJohn Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,\nAnd led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.\nNow Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.\n\u0026hellip;\nThe high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.\nJesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.\nWhy askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.\nAnd when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?\nJesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?\nNow Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.\n\u0026hellip;\nThen led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.\nPilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?\nThey answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.\nThen said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:\nThat the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.\nThen Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?\nJesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?\nPilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?\nJesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.\nPilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.\nPilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.\nBut ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?\nThen cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.\n\u0026hellip;\nThen Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.\nAnd the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,\nAnd said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.\nPilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.\nThen came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!\nWhen the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.\nThe Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.\nWhen Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;\nAnd went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.\nThen saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?\nJesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.\nAnd from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar\u0026rsquo;s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.\nWhen Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.\nAnd it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!\nBut they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.\nThen delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.\n— John 18:12-14, 19-24, 28-40, 19:1-16, KJV\nJohn, the one Gnostic-flavored non-Synoptic Gospel, predictably tells a rather different story. The major story beats are the same, but the details are unique. In John, Caiaphas, the High Priest, seeks to kill Jesus because it is better for one man to die than a whole nation. In other words, Jesus is being sacrificed to Rome to protect the rest of the nation. In John\u0026rsquo;s account, it is explicitly the chief priests who advocate for his execution. Jesus does not claim to be the Messiah, responding instead only in cryptic allusions to the Kingdom. Barabbas is downgraded from rebel and murderer to simply robber. Pilate is incredibly loathe to execute Jesus, appealing to the Jewish authorities on his behalf multiple times. The Jewish authorities seem to charge Jesus with challenging Caesar politically.\nAnalysis There are a few components of the story which are consistent across all tellings.\nOne is the question of whether Jesus is the Messiah. Among modern Christians, the Messiah is generally understood to be a spiritual savior who liberates people from their sin. In Jewish thought, especially around the 1st Century CE, the Messiah was explicitly a military and political figure who would unite the Jews, expel the Romans, and establish an independent theocratic Jewish nation-state. Jesus was far from the only potential claimant to the title. Judas Maccabee, the founder of the Hasmonean Dynasty, was thought by many of his backers to be the Messiah. We can see, then, that any possible Messiah would be a threat to established powers on multiple fronts.\nFirst, a Messiah would be a threat to the power of the Hasmonean priests and Sadducees. The Temple cult was already controlled by the descendants of one alleged Messiah, and a new one was likely to usurp their position. Second, a Messiah would be a threat to the already-tenuous relationship between Judea and Rome. Judean resentments toward increasing taxation and military occupation are evident throughout the Gospel narratives, especially evident in the widespread hostility toward tax collectors who were viewed as traitors and Roman collaborators. There was widespread fear, especially among the ruling classes, that if these tensions came to a head in armed revolt, it would spell the end of the Judean state. Indeed, it did\u0026mdash;the Temple and state both were destroyed in 70 CE following a rebellion!\nThe second commonality is the presence of the second prisoner, Barabbas. Half of the Gospels imply that Barabbas is a Zealot who has been arrested for rebellion against Rome and murder. So why, if Messianism is to be avoided because of the fear of armed conflict with Rome, would the Jewish authorities release Barabbas? First, we should establish that there is neither substantial evidence nor scholarly consensus over whether Barabbas was a real figure. His name is \u0026ldquo;Son of the Father\u0026rdquo; in Aramaic, which is possibly a poetic epithet, and he may represent an idea rather than a literal individual person. He is Jesus\u0026rsquo;s foil. We see the Jewish authorities choose between the Son of Man, the pacifist who eschews an earthly kingdom for a spiritual one, and the Son of the Father, a militant who seeks a material political kingdom of Judah. The Gospel writers seem to be highlighting Jesus\u0026rsquo;s message: the Kingdom of Heaven is a kingdom of spirit characterized by reversals; the last will be first; the poor will be elevated, and the rich brought low; and its king will triumph, not by conquest, but by humbling himself to the death of a criminal.\nThe third commonality is that it is always the Hasmonean priests who encite the crowds to urge Pilate to crucify Jesus and release Barabbas. We have established the Sadducees\u0026rsquo; willingness to engage in political machinations to maintain the status quo and preserve the priesthood, so if we are going to blame any of the Jews for the death of Jesus, it should be those guys specifically. The Sadducees essentially disappeared after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, and modern Judaism evolved out of the Pharisaic rabbinic tradition of \u0026ldquo;portable Judaism\u0026rdquo;, so there is no reason to hold modern Jews accountable for the actions of one faction which even we have rejected!\nFinally, according to the Gospel narratives, the Jewish authorities lacked the right to exercise capital punishment. Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, surely had the power to pardon Jesus, and surely was not obligated to kill him just because the high priests wanted him to. In the account of Paul\u0026rsquo;s life in Acts, Paul manages to reduce his own sentance to one of house arrest, where he stays until the end of the book\u0026mdash;it is unclear if he was even executed or simply died in his home of old age or disease. Why was it so hard to kill Paul, but so hard to not kill Jesus? The whole account, while a beautiful literary conclusion to the life of Jesus as told in the Gospels, simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold up to scrutiny.\nConclusion There is no evidence that Jesus was a real historical figure. The Gospel accounts of the crucifixion are unlikely to have occurred as described, and do not line up with historical accounts of Roman executions and Roman political power and procedure. Even in the Gospel accounts, the worst the Jews as a whole did was fall into a mob mentality incited by a faction of political elites protecting their own power\u0026mdash;aka bootlickers.\nThe Jews are not guilty of deicide, and this accusation has been the cause of millennia of violence against Jews.\nReferences Charles, L.

The current regime, the Hasmonean Dynasty, came to power after a successful rebellion against the Hellenistic successors of Alexander the Great, and promptly made Judea into a Roman vassal state. Contemporary politics featured three major factions: the Pharisees, who emphasized obedience to the Law and personal responsibility; the Sadducees, who emphasized the Temple cult and engaged in politics to protect the interests of the Hasmonean priesthood; and the Zealots, who were guerilla military bands seeking independence from Rome.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Judaism for Gentiles 3: Did \"The Jews\" Kill Jesus?"},{"content":"Historical Background In Jesus\u0026rsquo;s day, Judaism was in a time of significant change and upheaval. Second Temple religion and politics were a struggle between three major factions. The Sadducees represented the priestly Temple cult; the Pharisees advocated for a legalistic or scribal cult born in the Babylonian exile; and the Zealots were a military faction intent on Judean independence from Rome.\nThe Maccabees Judea\u0026rsquo;s location on the Mediterranean coast and between Egypt and Asia Minor make it militarily and economically valuable. Following the death of Alexander the Great, his successors competed for control of the region. The various ruling classes of Judea invariably sided with different Hellenistic factions, seeing political and economic advantages. As a result, Hellenism became increasingly appealing to Judean aristocrats. Greek replaced Hebrew, kosher laws were ignored, a hymnasium was built in which Jews competed in Hellenistic athletic games nude, and circumcisions were either not performed or reversed.\nWhile the ruling classes were in support of Hellenization, the common farmers and laborers were loathe to surrender the god and traditions of their fathers. Tensions came to a head when Antiochus looted the Temple in Jerusalem in 170 BCE. A faction of guerilla rebel fighters formed under Mattathias, and later his son, Judas Maccabee, who \u0026ldquo;tore down altars, circumcised Jewish children that had been left uncircumcised, and exhorted Jews everywhere to join in the revolt\u0026rdquo; (Buttrick, 1962).\nThe Maccabean Revolt was successful. The Temple was cleansed, all remnants of unclean or idolatrous practices were purged, and proper sacrifices were resumed in 165 BCE. Judas Maccabees, seeing Rome\u0026rsquo;s policy of relative self-governance as the most favorable to ensure Judean religion\u0026rsquo;s long-term survival, allied Judea with Rome, making Judea a Roman vassal state.\nThe priestly line, disrupted by Hellenization, had to be reinstated. Judas\u0026rsquo;s own descendant, Simon Maccabeus, would take control of the Temple and priestly duties, establishing the Hasmonean Dynasty.\nThe Sadducees There is much debate, both today and in conflicting historical sources, over the niche the Sadducees occupied. What we can say with relativve certainty is that the Sadducees were supporters of the Hasmonean priestly line and were primarily concerned with maintaining the Temple cult.\nWhen defining the Sadducees, it is helpful to consider them in the frameworks of political and economic class. In contrast with the more apolitical Pharisees, the Sadducees saw the continuation of the Temple cult as dependent on politics. Thus, they engaged in poligical negotiations with Rome in order to protect priestly interests, earning them a reputation as Roman collaborators. Economically, they represented the aristocratic class, maintaining their position through crude power. The Pharisees, by contrast, represented the more mild-mannered and charismatic mercantile class. In essence, the Sadducees were preservers of the status quo.\nThe Pharisees Prior to the destruction of the First Temple in 587 BCE, Judean religious practice was centered on the Temple cult. Sacrifices and festivals were centralized at the Temple in Jerusalem and were under the purview of a heriditary priestly class, the descendants of Aaron and Levi.\nDuring the Babylonian Exile, the period of time between Babylon\u0026rsquo;s conquest of Judea and the restoration of the Temple under Cyrus the Great in 516 BCE, Temple sacrifices were impossible. In order to maintain their identity as a distinct people and maintain their devotion to Yahweh, a new form of Judean religion, centered instead around the Book of the Law, was developed. Temple sacrifice was replaced by prayer, priestly duties by individual observance of the mitzvot, or commandments. This \u0026ldquo;portable Judaism\u0026rdquo; became the basis of Pharisaism, and the sect gained momentum as the power of the Hasmonean priests waned.\nAnother characteristic of the Pharisees was their insistence on separateness. They took very seriously the Levitical purity codes, a series of rules and prohibitions related to ritual purity. In order to live in strict alignment with the Book of the Law, the Pharisees saw it necessary to separate themselves from Gentiles, and even from non-Pharisees. This ensured that they would not come into contact with unclean foods, substances, or practices.\nThe Zealots The militaristic zeal which the Maccabees inspired did not vanish with the establishment of the Hasmonean Dynasty. Guerilla bands continued to occupy the Judean Hill Country, carrying out small-scale raids against what they considered Rome and her collaborators. This militaristic trend culminated in a rebellion against Rome in 66 BCE, and the total destruction of the Second Temple and the Judean state in 70 CE.\nWhat Jesus Said Now that we have an idea of what Judaism looked like in the time of Jesus, we can make sense of some of the things Jesus said about his contemporaries in the Gospel accounts.\nThe Sadducees The Gospels reference the Sadducees independently of the Pharisees only in regards to one incident, in which the Sadducees ask a weirdly specific legal question about marriage post-resurrection. The question is pretty clearly a trap to try to get Jesus to say something stupid, which is a common motif in the Gospel narratives (Matt 22:23, Mark 12:18, Luke 20:27). It\u0026rsquo;s not terribly helpful to answer our question. Instead, we have to infer his attitude indirectly.\nOne incident which puts Jesus somewhat directly at odds with the Sadducees is the famous Temple table-flipping.\nAnd they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;\nAnd would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.\nAnd he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.\nAnd the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.\n— Mark 11:15-18, KJV\nJesus is critical of the Sadducees\u0026rsquo; relegation of spiritual matters to economic and political concerns. This incident, which emphasizes prayer over strict adherence to the Temple cult, does suggest that Jesus is at least somewhat more aligned with the Pharisees than the Sadducees. There is no evidence that the type of commerce occuring here is anything but commerce related to the Temple cult. It would have been normal for a now-international Judean community to require moneychangers in order to purchase doves for Temple sacrifices. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Jesus is objecting to commerce or profit in and of itself. He may be objecting to the Temple cult in general, or to the fact that such an industry exists in the first place when the poor, the widow, and the orphan continue to go uncared for.\nThe Pharisees The Pharisees get a pretty bad rap among modern Christians. Indeed, Jesus was pretty hard on them, in the same way that Christians are generally more critical of other denominations of Christianity than they are of, say, Buddhists or Hindus. We argue most fiercely with family, and Jesus was theologically much closer to the Pharisees than the Sadducees.\nIn the famous Temple of the Mount (Matt 5), Jesus backs up the Pharisaic emphasis on Law and personal responsibility. However, he takes his doctrine one surprising step forward, declaring that the Pharisees are not even righteous enough to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and that obedience to an even deeper law is required. Jesus draws from the writings of the Prophets, rather than the writings of the Torah alone, to make his arguments. He declares that not only is killing wrong, but the anger, resentment, and hatred that result in killing are just as wrong.\nCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\nYet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.\nWherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.\nBehold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.\nIs it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?\nIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?\nIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\nThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward.\nThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;\nAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:\nAnd the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\nAnd they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.\nIf thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:\nThen shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\n— Isaiah 58, KJV\nThe Prophetic tradition scoffs at Judea\u0026rsquo;s fasts and sacrifices as empty husks. The \u0026ldquo;true fast\u0026rdquo; is to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and liberate the captive. What meaning is there to religious observance if you ignore the human suffering in your midst? The Prophetic literature envisions a future in which the Judeans\u0026rsquo; hardened hearts will be replaced altogether, spiritually transformed: \u0026ldquo;A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh\u0026rdquo; (Ezekiel 32:26, KJV).\nJesus is so critical of the Pharisaic tendency toward legalism sans social justice that he compares them to tombs: \u0026ldquo;Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men\u0026rsquo;s bones, and of all uncleanness\u0026rdquo; (Matt 23:27, KJV), mirroring the language of Ezekiel.\nNor did Jesus agree with the Pharisees\u0026rsquo; ideals of separateness.\nAnd it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.\nAnd when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\nBut when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.\nBut go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\n— Matt 9:10-13, KJV\nJesus takes social justice several steps out of the Pharisees\u0026rsquo; comfort zone and willingly, even flagrantly, violates the purity codes in order to raise up sinners and tax collectors (short-hand for Roman collaborators).\nThe Zealots Jesus rather clearly does not support armed resistance against Rome.\nAnd they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.\nAnd when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?\nShall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.\nAnd they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar\u0026rsquo;s.\nAnd Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u0026rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God\u0026rsquo;s. And they marvelled at him.\n— Mark 12:13-17, KJV\nThis is another trap question, rather clearly intended to try to get Jesus to say something explicitly anti-Rome to get him into trouble. He completely subverts their expectations, as though Platonic dualism was not a well-known principle in Hellenistic Judea.\nThe Sermon on the Mount is full of little anti-violence tidbits, like turning the other cheek. John, which is drastically different from the other Gospels in many ways, also attests to his policy of nonviolence: \u0026ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence\u0026rdquo; (John 18:36).\nConclusion Jesus was a Jew, and the early Jesus movement was likely not an attempt to start a new religion but an attempt to reform Judaism. Jesus rejected pure ritual and pure legalism, arguing, in the Prophetic tradition, that social justice, caring for the most vulnerable segments of the population, were more important.\nReferences Buttrick, G.

The Historical Jesus A prerequisite question to consider is whether Jesus existed as a legitimate historical figure. Christians answer this question in a variety of ways, with more conservative or fundamentalist sects asserting definitively that, yes, Jesus was a real historical figure, and more liberal sects being more open to the possibility that he may not have been. Modern historical scholarship tends to side with the latter opinion.\nThe Gospel narratives are the strongest evidence for the existence of the historical Jesus, but there are a number of issues which prevent them from serving as definitive proof.\nthe New Testament contains contradictory historical accounts of various parts of early Christianity\u0026hellip; The account of the birth of Jesus and the origins of his family provided by Matthew is totally different from that in Luke, and any harmonization cannot stand up to the standards of modern historiography. The different narratives of his resurrection appearances\u0026mdash;who of his disciples claimed they had seen him, when, and where?\u0026mdash;in Mark, Matthew, Luke, and Paul contradict one another. The New Testament is simply not a reliable source for the history of Jesus or early Christianity when taken at face value.\n— Martin, 2012\nThis is often the case with ancient historical sources. All sources are biased: the data a historian chooses to examine, the way they construct and present arguments, and the conclusions they draw are all interpretations the historian is making for the reader. Ancient writers and historians had no concept for historical accuracy in the modern sense; they were less concerned with preserving exact words, numbers, dates, and the like than they were with presenting an interpretation of events which would help the reader to make sense out of events.\nWe do much the same today. If a child asks how electricity works, we answer with an interpretation. \u0026ldquo;There is power in the walls, and that power can travel through these wires, and that makes machines work.\u0026rdquo; We might say something about the movement of electrons. What we don\u0026rsquo;t do is hand the child a physics textbook and a stack of electrical diagrams. The ancient writer, of course, had no electrical diagrams! The number of men in an army had to be counted and relayed to the historian\u0026rsquo;s ear, quotes and dialog were written from memory or else made up in such a way as to most accurately convey the intended message, and so on.\nArcheological evidence, that is contemporary material objects which have survived and been discovered and studied, is a different beast altogether. Pieces of pottery, statues, figurines, and graffiti do not often explain themselves. No historian or writer has preemptively interpreted them for us. It is up to the archeologist to examine material culture and figure out what an object meant, how it was used, or what social function it served.\nPossibly the oldest verifiable archeological evidence of the historical Jesus is the Alexamenos graffiti, dated to ca. 200 CE, depicting a horse-headed figure hanging from a cross with the caption \u0026ldquo;Alexamenos worships his god\u0026rdquo;.\nThis graffiti does less to prove that Jesus existed than it does to prove that the Jesus cult was active around 200 CE, over a century after Jesus\u0026rsquo;s death.\nWe will save the analysis of the Gospel accounts for the next section. Right now, it\u0026rsquo;s enough for us to say that there is not enough solid evidence to establish the existence of a historical Jesus of Nazareth.\nRabbinic Period There is little to no Talmudic literature which deals with Jesus directly. There are a handful of references that seem to point to Jesus, but there is no consensus, and Yeshua was an unfortunately common name. All the same, we will examine a few examples.\nOn Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.\nUlla said: And how can you understand this proof? Was Jesus the Nazarene worthy of conducting a search for a reason to acquit him? He was an inciter to idol worship, and the Merciful One states with regard to an inciter to idol worship: “Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him” (Deuteronomy 13:9). Rather, Jesus was different, as he had close ties with the government, and the gentile authorities were interested in his acquittal. Consequently, the court gave him every opportunity to clear himself, so that it could not be claimed that he was falsely convicted.\n— Sanhedrin 43a, Koren-Steinsaltz, 2012\nThis passage is actually dealing with the rights of the accused to have a crier go out before his execution to seek proof of his innocence, an ancient sort of due process. The Jesus in this story is accused of inciting people to worship idols, a crime which would normally result in his forfeiting this right. The Rabbis clarify that he was given this right anyway because the Gentile authorities did not want him executed, making it easier to send a crier than to deal with the Roman government.\nThe account of this Jesus the Nazarene\u0026rsquo;s execution does not match the Gospel narratives in any way. This Jesus is stoned rather than crucified, and while the Gospels\u0026rsquo; Jesus is executed by the Roman state, this Jesus is apparently on such good terms with the Roman state that they have a vested interest in his acquittal. So is this the same Jesus?\nEven the accusation of inciting idol worship is a flimsy match. Jesus does not generally claim to be divine himself; it is mostly from the later writings of the disciples and especially Paul that this idea emerges. Jesus is therefore more the object of idolatry rather than the inciter.\nYehoshua ben Peraḥya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper’s wife are narrow [terutot]. Yehoshua ben Peraḥya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.\nJesus came before Yehoshua ben Peraḥya several times and said to him: Accept our, i.e., my, repentance. Yehoshua ben Peraḥya took no notice of him. One day Yehoshua ben Peraḥya was reciting Shema and Jesus came before him with the same request. Yehoshua ben Peraḥya intended to accept his request, and signaled him with his hand to wait until he completed his prayer. Jesus did not understand the signal and thought: He is driving me away. He went and stood a brick upright to serve as an idol and he bowed to it. Yehoshua ben Peraḥya then said to Jesus: Repent. Jesus said to him: This is the tradition that I received from you: Whoever sins and causes the masses to sin is not given the opportunity to repent. And the Master says: Jesus performed sorcery, incited Jews to engage in idolatry, and led Israel astray. Had Yehoshua ben Peraḥya not caused him to despair of atonement, he would not have taken the path of evil.\n— Sanhedrin 107b, Koren-Steinsaltz, 2012\nIn this story, Jesus is driven to incite others to idolatry by the stubborn refusal of his Rabbi to accept his repentance. This is more a cautionary tale encouraging one to be forgiving than a case against an idolator. It is a reminder not to let the evil inclination overtake you, and not to erect needless barriers before others which will cause them to stumble.\nTo sum up, Rabbinical literature may condemn Jesus as a heretic of sorts, but this is significantly softened by the latter story which lays the blame with his teacher. The incongruities between these accounts and the Gospel accounts make it unclear whether the Rabbis are even talking about the right Jesus, so they may have had nothing to say about him whatsoever.\nToday Many articles written by Christian sources will assert that Jews reject Jesus as Messiah and deny his divinity. This phrasing is misleading; it makes it sound like rejecting and denying are things Jews are actively doing. In truth, most Jews don\u0026rsquo;t go out of their way to think about Jesus in one way or another.\nWe do, however, live in a largely Christian society, and therefore must, by necessity, spend at least some time and mental effort distinguishing Judaism from the dominant Christian culture. This process is largely a matter of culture and identity, rather than one of religious belief. The average Jew does not celebrate Christmas, and, if asked \u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; will reply, \u0026ldquo;Because Jews don\u0026rsquo;t believe in Jesus.\u0026rdquo; This answer must, however, be prompted by a society in which the celebration of Christian is the cultural norm. Jews are perfectly happy celebrating our own religious festivals. I don\u0026rsquo;t think about Christmas until somebody asks me why I don\u0026rsquo;t celebrate it. It is this failure to assimilate into dominant Christian cultural practices that comes closest to the modern Jew\u0026rsquo;s rejecting of Jesus.\nIn much the same way, the Christian reader would be unlikely to have an opinion on Hillel and Shammai. If we were to put the shoe on the other foot, and imagine that we lived in a predominantly Jewish culture, perhaps the reader would find it perplexing that everybody expects them to articulate their preference for one or the other. Imagine being asked in school by a classmate, \u0026ldquo;Do you side with the House of Hillel or the House of Shammai?\u0026rdquo; You would reply, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I\u0026rsquo;m Christian and don\u0026rsquo;t follow the Rabbis,\u0026rdquo; and your classmate would be dumbfounded by your denial of halakha and rejection of the Rabbis.\nDo Jews today view Jesus as divine? No. Not because we dislike Jesus, but because it would be idolatrous according to our interpretation of Torah. Do we accept him as Messiah? Also no. But this is not so unusual: we don\u0026rsquo;t accept Sabbatai Zevi, Simon bar Kokhba, Moses of Crete, Abu Isa, Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia, or any number of other claimants either.\nThe short answer to the question, \u0026ldquo;What do Jews think about Jesus?\u0026rdquo; is, \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\nReferences Koren-Steinsaltz.

From what I can find, arguments on either side of that question are mostly propaganda in support of a political agenda for or against Zionism and claims of Jewish indigeneity to the Levant.\nIn answering this question, it seems to make sense to approach its various parts chronologically, so this essay will begin with a whirlwind overview of the evidence of Israelite-Judean presence in the Levant, then cover evidence for the historicity of the Edict of Cyrus, and finally briefly-but-not-really-at-all touch on claims of indigeneity and modern political philosophy as it applies to the modern state of Israel. Please feel free to skip around.\nDisclosure of possible bias: the author is a Jew.\nEarly Israelite-Judean Presence in the Levant Merneptah The earliest extrabiblical textual evidence of a people group called Israel is the Merneptah Stele, unearthed in Thebes, Egypt, and dated to c. 1208 BCE. The last section of text on the stele celebrates Merneptah\u0026rsquo;s military victories in Canaan:\nThe princes are prostrate, saying \u0026lsquo;Peace!\u0026rsquo;\nNot one raises his head among the Nine Bows.\nDesolation is for Tjehenu;\nHatti is pacified;\nPlundered is the Canaan with every evil;\nCarried off is Asqaluni;\nSeized upon is Gezer;\nYanoam is made non-existent;\nIsrael is laid waste—its seed is no more;\nKharru has become a widow because of Egypt.\nAll lands together are pacified.\nEveryone who was restless has been bound.\n— Chavalas, 2021\nConquest Joshua 2-12 recounts the Israelites\u0026rsquo; invasion of Canaan and the complete annihilation of the Canaanites. This story is directly contradicted in later sections of Joshua, as well as in Judges and 2 Samuel. The invasion is also not supported archeologically: excavations of several cities named in Josh 2-12 show \u0026ldquo;no evidence of extensive conquest in thirteenth- and twelfth-century B.C.E. layers\u0026rdquo; (Hayes, 2012). Jericho had been abandoned for two centuries at the time of the alleged conquest, so Joshua certainly did not miraculously take the city through magical circumambulations.\nImmigration The next few sections draw heavily from Gottwald, 1979.\nOne theory of Israelites\u0026rsquo; entry into Canaan is that they immigrated into un- or sparsely-populated regions of the hill country, avoiding fortified Canaanite cities, and slowly came to take over the whole territory. There was, indeed, a great deal of political upheaval at the time. The Mycenaean civilization, Trojan Wars, and Hittite invasion of Anatolia, coupled with Egypt\u0026rsquo;s weakening grip on the region, resulted in significant migration into the Levant, especially from the Mediterranean.\nThis theory posits that Israel migrated into the Levant during this period from the east at the same time the Pelas moved in from the west via the Mediterranean. However, the archeological evidence does not support a theory of extensive Israelite migration into the Levant in the thirteenth century. Excavations of many sites listed in the biblical text do show new settlement, but these settlements\u0026rsquo; material culture is identical to that of other Canaanite settlements, with the exception of a startling lack of pig bones. This seems to suggest that these settlements were rather established by groups of Canaanites who had recently adopted a religious prohibition of consuming pork.\nRevolution Another theory is one of social revolution, and draws on textual evidence from the Amarna letters, government correspondence between Egypt and Canaan. In short, the letters describe a troublemaking group of social outcasts called the Habiru, who had a reputation as raiders, outlaws, and slaves. This theory posits that some Habirus escaped Egypt, settled in Canaan, and introduced the worship of their liberator god into the region. While this theory is attractive because of its consistency with the archeological continuity discussed above and its explanation of the origin of the Exodus story, the linguistic connection between \u0026ldquo;Habiru\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Hebrew\u0026rdquo; is tenuous at best, and there is, as far as I can see, no material evidence to support it.\nGradual Emergence The final theory of Israelite migration into the Levant is actually not one of migration at all. Rather, this theory posits that some Canaanites just decided to take up a new religion and started new settlements. These groups united into a loose confederation predicated on shared religious practice and eventually became Israel.\nTherefore, we can establish that, by the thirteenth century BCE, there was most likely a loose confederation of tribes or people groups, at least some of whom were known by the name Israel, who were united by a mono- or henotheistic worship of Yahweh living in the Levant.\nMonarchy There is some evidence that there was a historical Kingdom of Israel. The Tel Dan Stele and Mesha Stele both refer to the \u0026ldquo;House of David\u0026rdquo;. Unlike the thirteenth century, there is ample evidence that somebody was developing an urban society in the Levant in the tenth century. Naturally, each archeological find is hotly debated, but the scholarly consensus seems to be that there probably was an Israelite kingdom or proto-kingdom, but that it was almost certainly not so large nor so unified as the biblical story claims.\nThe Babylonian Exile Of course, to establish the historicity of the Edict of Cyrus, we must first establish the historicity of the Babylonian Exile.\nThe Babylonian Chronicles corroborate a military campaign against Israel in 597:\nIn the seventh year, in the month of Kislev, the king of Akkad mustered his troops, marched to the Hatti-land, and encamped against the City of Judah and on the ninth day of the month of Adar he seized the city and captured the king. He appointed there a king of his own choice and taking heavy tribute brought it back to Babylon.\n— Finḳelshṭayn, 2001\nArcheological evidence supports the near-total destruction of Jerusalem in 587 and the deportation of at least 20,000 Judeans.\nThe Edict of Cyrus All that to say that the Edict of Cyrus was almost certainly a real event; whether it applied to the Judeans is, however, up for debate.\nThe Cyrus Cylinder This baby is about as definitive as it gets.\nWhen I entered Babylon as a friend and (when) I established the seat of the government in the palace of the ruler under jubilation and rejoicing, Marduk, the great lord, [induced] the magnanimous inhabitants of Babylon [to love me], and I was daily endeavouring to worship him. My numerous troops walked around in Babylon in peace, I did not allow anybody to terrorize (any place) of the [country of Sumer] and Akkad. I strove for peace in Babylon and in all his (other) sacred cities. As to the inhabitants of Babylon, [who] against the will of the gods [had/were\u0026hellip;, I abolished] the corvée (lit.: yoke) which was against their (social) standing. I brought relief to their dilapidated housing, putting (thus) an end to their (main) complaints. Marduk, the great lord, was well pleased with my deeds and sent friendly blessings to myself, Cyrus, the king who worships him, to Cambyses, my son, the offspring of [my] loins, as well as to all my troops, and we all [praised] his great [godhead] joyously, standing before him in peace.\nAll the kings of the entire world from the Upper to the Lower Sea, those who are seated in throne rooms, (those who) live in other [types of buildings as well as] all the kings of the West land living in tents, brought their heavy tributes and kissed my feet in Babylon. (As to the region) from\u0026hellip; as far as Ashur and Susa, Agade, Eshnunna, the towns Zamban, Me-Turnu, Der as well as the region of the Gutians, I returned to (these) sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to ‘live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations. Furthermore, I resettled upon the command of Marduk, the great lord, all the gods of Sumer and Akkad whom Nabonidus has brought into Babylon to the anger of the lord of the gods, unharmed, in their (former) chapels, the places which make them happy.\nMay all the gods whom I have resettled in their sacred cities ask daily Bel and Nebo for a long life for me and may they recommend me (to him); to Marduk, my lord, they may say this: “Cyrus, the king who worships you, and Cambyses, his son, \u0026hellip; all of them I settled in a peaceful place\u0026hellip; ducks and doves, \u0026hellip; I endeavoured to fortify/repair their dwelling places\u0026hellip;\n— Pritchard, 2011\nKuhrt points out two pieces of evidence that further flesh out the story of Cyrus, one a chronicle covering the reign of Nabonidus of Babylon, and one a poem condemning Nabonidus and praising Cyrus. Kuhrt accepts the Cylinder\u0026rsquo;s authenticity but questions the motives of the Cylinder and poem, which she sees as propaganda pieces to support Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s rule. Her translation of a fragment of the chronicle supports her view: \u0026ldquo;when Cyrus did battle\u0026hellip; against the army of Akkad, the people of Akkad retreated. He (sc. Cyrus) carried off the plunder (and) slaughtered the people\u0026rdquo; (Kuhrt, 1988). For my part, it seems only natural for ancient sources to overly praise one\u0026rsquo;s rulers and vilify one\u0026rsquo;s enemies, and neither the negative Babylonian presentation nor the positive Persian presentation are striking evidence for anything in particular. More interesting is her claim that the Cylinder text echoes earlier texts from Merodach-Baladan II (721) and Sargon II (710), such that Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s claim that he has been selected for rule by Marduk because of the previous king\u0026rsquo;s oppressive rule had been in vogue since the 8th century. She cites the repatriation of peoples and their gods as the \u0026ldquo;concrete expression\u0026rdquo; of this divine restoration, but it\u0026rsquo;s unclear to me if she means that the previous kings also had such a policy. Either way, this is either evidence that Cyrus had precedent for restoring resident aliens to their homes, and therefore he probably did, or evidence that this was merely a literary convention, and therefore he probably didn\u0026rsquo;t. I think the former is more convincing.\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the Cyrus Cylinder almost definitely refers to an actual Edict that actually repatriated peoples and their gods to at least Sumer and Mesopotamia.\nEzra-Nehemiah I have to preface this section by stating that I have spent the last day poring over hundreds of pages of peer-reviewed arguments over Ezra-Nehemiah\u0026rsquo;s authenticity and historicity. There is no consensus that I can discern. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of controversy over a very small amount of text. I will present the most interesting and compelling arguments here.\nThe question at hand is, as I see it, over whether Cyrus facilitated the return of the Judeans to Judah, and not over whether Cyrus specifically supported the construction of a temple on Zion, so we will skip past arguments that Ezra-Nehemiah reflect an anti-Samaritan bias and delegitimization of worship at Mount Gerizim.\nThe Edict of Cyrus is presented in Ezra 1:2-4:\nThus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.\n— Ezra 1:2-4, KJV\nWhether this fragment is an actual Persian proclamation or only written in the style of one, there are some interesting features to point out. Cyrus refers to the \u0026ldquo;Lord God of heaven\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Lord God of Israel\u0026rdquo;, consistent with the Persian government\u0026rsquo;s policy that \u0026ldquo;Persian administration necessarily styled the deities of the subject peoples in agreement with the phraseology used by the latter\u0026rdquo; (Bickerman, 2007). Contemporary known-authentic documents employ this technique when referring to Marduk, Sin, Neith, and Khnum.\nThe translations make it rather confusing to figure out who is giving gold and silver to whom. At a glance, this looks reminiscent of the Hebrews robbing asking for gifts from the Egyptians on their way to the reed sea, but Bickerman proposes another reading. First, it is important to note that the Judeans maintained a distinct ethnic identity throughout the Exile. \u0026ldquo;Among the ancients, a resident alien and his descendants preserved his original nationality indefinitely, unless he was admitted among the citizens\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the Exiles formed communities under their own chiefs\u0026hellip; Herodotus says that they lived in a village \u0026lsquo;by themselves.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Certainly, the construction of a historiography (Deut thru 2 Kings) that presented the destruction of Jerusalem as part of, and not contradictory to, the Covenant helped to maintain the Israelite-Judean religion in exile. In any case, Bickerman\u0026rsquo;s analysis of the grammar in the Aramaic suggests that it is the Judeans who choose to remain in Babylon who are commanded to give gifts to those who are returning to Judah, to help them get established. A perfectly sound policy. Arguably, this is still the case today, at least to an extent and perhaps extralegally, and it has certainly been the case for Jews in Europe for the last thousand years, as evidenced by the blood libels, expulsions, pogroms, etc.\nEzra 6:10 gives Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s motivation for allowing the Judeans to rebuild Jerusalem: \u0026ldquo;That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.\u0026rdquo; This is perfectly in line with the text of the Cylinder.\nThus far, the evidence suggests that the Edict, as presented in Ezra-Nehemiah, is plausibly authentic. We can\u0026rsquo;t prove that it\u0026rsquo;s authentic, but if it isn\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty convincing imitation. This seems to be Blankenship\u0026rsquo;s position, who argues that \u0026ldquo;Achaemenid strategies\u0026hellip; are co-opted by the Jewish historian as well, and to some extent by the figures of Ezra and Nehemiah within the narrative\u0026hellip; [T]he author of Ezra-Nehemiah\u0026hellip; employs these authoritative Persian techniques, with guarantees of their power supplied both by literal Persian authorization and by the higher authority of YHWH, for the rhetorical purposes of asserting the self-determinacy and internal constitution of the Jewish Yehudite community after the return from Babylonia\u0026rdquo; (Blankenship, 2024).\nObligatory Josephus Section The historicity of the Edict and return of Judeans to Judah is corroborated by Herodotus and Josephus, whom I consider to be very poor historians.\nTrickle Theory Some sources suggested that the return from Babylon was not quite so dramatic and that it was a natural trickle of migration. Barring any substantial evidence for a significant wave of migration or for the authenticity of the Ezra-Nehemiah fragments, this is as good a theory as any.\nIn any case, we can be pretty sure that the Judeans who were in Judah during the Roman occupation are the same ones who returned from Babylon, regardless of how much Cyrus did or did not have to do with it.\nDNA The DNA evidence is pretty consistent with the gradual emergence model and confirms that modern Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jews all originate from the Levant (Katsnelson, 2010).\nPolitical Philosophy All history is politically motivated. Archeological digs only get funded if somebody thinks they\u0026rsquo;ll like what they find. Archeological records are easily destroyed by bulldozers and tree-planting projects.\nIt can be argued from the above evidence that Jews are indigenous to the Levant. How does the concept of indigeneity apply outside geographically isolated populations who were colonized and subjugated by the West (e.g. the Americas, Australia, New Zealand)? Would a claim to indigeneity justify the reconquest of the land? Did and do the Jews need or deserve a homeland in the aftermath of the Holocaust? To what degree is Britain responsible for creating and abandoning the most half-baked attempt at creating a modern nation-state ever? Why couldn\u0026rsquo;t the new Jewish state have been somewhere else? Does the liturgically preserved longing for Jerusalem preclude any other geography?\nFor a detailed discussion of the political philosophies surrounding Zionism, anti-Zionism, etc., I refer you to Chaim Gans\u0026rsquo;s A Political Theory for the Jewish People.\nConclusion The Edict of Cyrus was most likely a real thing that happened.\nWhether it applied to Judea is unclear, but the Judeans did return to Judea during Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s reign, either by his invitation or via natural migration because he didn\u0026rsquo;t stop them.\nPolitical philosophy isn\u0026rsquo;t fun for me. One side claims Jews are indigenous to the Levant and therefore have a right to the land. The other side claims that Jews are just European converts and have no claim to the land. DNA says Jews definitely came from the Levant. Compassion says they don\u0026rsquo;t have a right to the land. Holocaust trauma says they need the land, whether they have an ancestral claim to it or not.\nFor my part, I agree with Samuel:\nוַיֹּ֕אמֶר זֶ֗ה יִֽהְיֶה֙ מִשְׁפַּ֣ט הַמֶּ֔לֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִמְלֹ֖ךְ עֲלֵיכֶ֑ם אֶת־בְּנֵיכֶ֣ם יִקָּ֗ח וְשָׂ֥ם לוֹ֙ בְּמֶרְכַּבְתּ֣וֹ וּבְפָרָשָׁ֔יו וְרָצ֖וּ לִפְנֵ֥י מֶרְכַּבְתּֽוֹ׃\nHe said, “This will be the practice of the king who will rule over you: He will take your sons and appoint them as his charioteers and horsemen, and they will serve as outrunners for his chariots.\nוְלָשׂ֣וּם ל֔וֹ שָׂרֵ֥י אֲלָפִ֖ים וְשָׂרֵ֣י חֲמִשִּׁ֑ים וְלַחֲרֹ֤שׁ חֲרִישׁוֹ֙ וְלִקְצֹ֣ר קְצִיר֔וֹ וְלַעֲשׂ֥וֹת כְּלֵֽי־מִלְחַמְתּ֖וֹ וּכְלֵ֥י רִכְבּֽוֹ׃\nHe will appoint them as his chiefs of thousands and of fifties; or they will have to plow his fields, reap his harvest, and make his weapons and the equipment for his chariots.\nוְאֶת־בְּנוֹתֵיכֶ֖ם יִקָּ֑ח לְרַקָּח֥וֹת וּלְטַבָּח֖וֹת וּלְאֹפֽוֹת׃\nHe will take your daughters as perfumers, cooks, and bakers.\nוְאֶת־שְׂ֠דֽוֹתֵיכֶ֠ם וְאֶת־כַּרְמֵיכֶ֧ם וְזֵיתֵיכֶ֛ם הַטּוֹבִ֖ים יִקָּ֑ח וְנָתַ֖ן לַעֲבָדָֽיו׃\nHe will seize your choice fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his courtiers.\nוְזַרְעֵיכֶ֥ם וְכַרְמֵיכֶ֖ם יַעְשֹׂ֑ר וְנָתַ֥ן לְסָרִיסָ֖יו וְלַעֲבָדָֽיו׃\nHe will take a tenth part of your grain and vintage and give it to his eunuchs and courtiers.\nוְֽאֶת־עַבְדֵיכֶם֩ וְֽאֶת־שִׁפְח֨וֹתֵיכֶ֜ם וְאֶת־בַּחוּרֵיכֶ֧ם הַטּוֹבִ֛ים וְאֶת־חֲמוֹרֵיכֶ֖ם יִקָּ֑ח וְעָשָׂ֖ה לִמְלַאכְתּֽוֹ׃\nHe will take your male and female slaves, your choice young men,-a and your asses, and put them to work for him.\nצֹאנְכֶ֖ם יַעְשֹׂ֑ר וְאַתֶּ֖ם תִּֽהְיוּ־ל֥וֹ לַעֲבָדִֽים׃\nHe will take a tenth part of your flocks, and you shall become his slaves.\nוּזְעַקְתֶּם֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֔וּא מִלִּפְנֵ֣י מַלְכְּכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּחַרְתֶּ֖ם לָכֶ֑ם וְלֹא־יַעֲנֶ֧ה יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם בַּיּ֥וֹם הַהֽוּא׃\nThe day will come when you cry out because of the king whom you yourselves have chosen; and the LORD will not answer you on that day.” ()\n— 1 Samuel 8:11-18\nCongratulations!

This essay treats the first season as a self-contained standalone story.\nWhat Is a Psychopomp? psychopomp (plural psychopomps)\n(religion) A spirit, deity, person, etc., who guides the souls of the dead to the afterlife. (Wiktionary, 2024) — Wiktionary\nA psychopomp ferries the souls of the dead from this world to the next. The Egyptian Anubis, the Germanic Wotan/Woden/Odin, and our own Grim Reaper — death itself personified — fulfill this psychopompic function.\nSigmund rose up, and sorrowed nigh to death over him; then he took the corpse in his arms and fared away to the wood, and went till he came to a certain firth; and there he saw a man in a little boat; and that man asked if he would be wafted by him over the firth, and he said yea thereto; but so little was the boat, that they might not all go in it at once, so the corpse was first laid therein, while Sigmund went by the firth-side. But therewith the boat and the man therein vanished away from before Sigmund\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\n— Völsunga Saga, Chapter X\nAnimals, too, may serve psychopompic functions. Odin was accompanied by two ravens, and, indeed, Germanic stories often set the scene for bloodshed by indicating the presence of hungry ravens and wolves on the soon-to-be battlefield, eagerly awaiting their next meal. This connection suggests that the above definition is perhaps too limited in scope. Carrion animals do not guide the souls of the dead, but rather guide the corpses of the dead in their transformation from useless, decaying matter. Psychopomps are functionally transformational.\nVultures orient us toward death as material transformation in a way that cares little for its cause\u0026hellip; The vulture is a species that the ancient Greeks identified as a psychopomp — an animal guide to the other side, a greeter at death\u0026rsquo;s door, a harbinger of demise. (Gray, 2017)\n— Gray, 2017\nIf the vulture, raven, and wolf are psychopomps in the material sense, transforming dead matter, the function of the deity is spiritual transformation. Narratively this takes the form of a metaphysical journey. Charon ferries the soul across the River Styx. The Valkyrie carries the slain to Valhalla. But if we peek behind the metaphor, we can speculate that this spiritual transformation is one which prepares the soul for whatever comes next.\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s dialogue, Meno, opens with this question by Meno: \u0026ldquo;Can you tell me Socrates — is virtue something that can be taught? Or does it come by practice? Or is it neither teaching nor practice that gives it to a man but natural aptitude or something else?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip; Whatever else the question entails properly as a consideration, it is a question about change: Can one go from a condition of being unlearned to one of being taught?\u0026hellip;\nLet us use one of Plato\u0026rsquo;s own examples from the Republic, the allegory of the cave\u0026hellip; Those who have managed to be freed from their fetters ascertain by the act of turning around from the wall where the shadows play that there is a source or a cause of the shadows. They can give themselves an adequate account (logos) of what they had seen, that the world of appearances is what they had known, and that world is henceforth known in terms of something else. When they make their way up out of the cave, coming to the surface of earth they — by practice now — are able to recognize their own and other images reflected in water by the light of the Sun\u0026hellip; But what have they been taught? And by whom have they been taught?\u0026hellip;\nThe allegory, which I am so briefly sketching here does not end with the emergence upon the surface of earth of those hitherto bound. They go back down into the cave to show, or to teach or to invite into the practice they have learned, those who remain there bound. There is, then, a very important sense in which such \u0026ldquo;teachers\u0026rdquo; are a kind of \u0026ldquo;psychopomp\u0026rdquo; leading the fettered soul from darkness to light\u0026hellip;\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s psychopomps (my term, not Plato\u0026rsquo;s) in his allegory of the cave show others where they have been and how they got there, even though they themselves do not know fully how they got there or even, indeed, where they arrived. They invite others into an activity. They invite others into a functioning freely — functioning freely, albeit alongside a dialectic (dia-logic) that is a partial account of what is happening to them.\n— Cooper, 1978\nIt is impossible to know, and pointless to speculate, how accurately the allegory of the cave applies to death, but the point remains that we can think of posthumous education as part of the role of the psychopomp. The psychopomp invites the deceased into the activity of death, whatever that may entail.\nRussian Doll S01E01 The tale tells that great fires were made endlong the hall, and the great tree aforesaid stood midmost thereof; withal folk say that, whenas men sat by the fires in the evening, a certain man came into the hall unknown of aspect to all men; and suchlike array he had, that over him was a spotted cloak, and he was bare-foot, and had linen-breeches knit tight even unto the bone, and he had a sword in his hand as he went up to the Branstock, and a slouched hat upon his head: huge he was, and seeming-ancient, and one-eyed.\n— Völsunga Saga, Chapter III\nWhen we first meet Horse, Nadia is leaving her birthday party with Mike. She sees Horse across the street, leaning against a fence, asking passersby if they have a quarter. Mike sees her staring and asks, \u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; to which Nadia replies, \u0026ldquo;I think I know that guy.\u0026rdquo;\nLater interactions with Horse will establish that she does not, in fact, know that guy.\nThe camera turns back around to Horse who is getting a light from another passerby. He takes a long drag on his cigarette while he stands barefoot, staring directly at the camera.\nMinutes later, Nadia sees her missing cat, steps into the street to retrieve him, is hit by a cab, and dies for the first time.\nIn the next loop, Nadia sees him again at the same intersection.\nNADIA: I think I know this guy. Hey! Do I know you?\nHORSE: What?\nNADIA: Do we know each other?\nHORSE: Fuck off.\n— S01E01\nWe next see Horse in her next loop, playfully swinging on the fence. It is very cute.\nNotice how Horse\u0026rsquo;s physical appearance is strikingly similar to the Volsungasaga\u0026rsquo;s description of Odin, the quintessential psychopomp of Northern Europe who harvests the souls of heroes and kings. He almost never appears in Midgard (earth, the mortal realm) except in the garb of a vagrant.\nWhile I find it unlikely that Horse is intended to be Odin-like here, he serves a similar function: that of a vagrant who facilitates a spiritual transformation. While the traditional psychopomp transforms the spirit from one of life to one of death, Horse puts Nadia\u0026rsquo;s soul on the path from brokenness to healing (and, depending on your interpretation of the series finale, this may be the same thing).\nIt is also possible that Horse is merely an example of \u0026ldquo;Wisdom from the Gutter\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t expect your average homeless person to want to talk, much less have a lesson they\u0026rsquo;re prepared to teach you (that somehow specifically addresses your problem)\u0026rdquo; (TV Tropes).\nS01E02 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.\n— Ecclesiastes 1:2, KJV\nUtter futility!—said Koheleth—\nUtter futility! All is futile!\n— Ecclesiastes 1:2, JPS\n\u0026ldquo;Vanity\u0026rdquo; is an interesting translation choice. The Hebrew word is \u0026ldquo;hevel\u0026rdquo;, breath or vapor. Hevel is like a mist. You can see it, but when you reach out to grasp it your hand comes away empty. It is the illusion of substance, the promise of fulfillment. Kohelet laments that all is hevel because he has tried all things, virtue and vice alike, and found it all as impermanent as the morning fog.\nAs Nadia struggles to confront her (im)mortality, she throws herself fully into her birthday party. We see a montage of heavy drinking and drug use until Nadia passes out on the couch. Hevel, hevel! All is hevel!\nS01E03 Nadia is wandering drunk through the park.\nHORSE: What\u0026rsquo;s on your head? I said, what\u0026rsquo;s on your head? Is that a wig or a hat?\nNADIA: Where\u0026rsquo;s your shoes, man?\nHORSE: Mmm, someone stole them last night at the shelter, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going back there, not ever. I don\u0026rsquo;t sleep among thieves.\nNADIA: Man, someone stole your shoes? Hey, what the fuck is going on in America, huh? What\u0026rsquo;s your name, do I know you?\nHORSE: No, you can call me Horse, if you want.\nNADIA: Alright, Horse, I\u0026rsquo;m Nadia. You want some?\nHORSE: Can I tell you something?\nNADIA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I\u0026rsquo;m, mm, y\u0026rsquo;know, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell me anything, you know, if I was you, because I\u0026rsquo;m just not the kind of person that you tell secrets to. Uh, I\u0026rsquo;m the abyss.\nThey both laugh uproariously.\nHORSE: I wanna cut your hair.\n— S01E03\nNadia immediately agrees. As Horse prepares his tools, Nadia jokes, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re gonna kill me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can change your mind.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; Horse says, brandishing his scissors.\nCut to post-haircut. Horse holds up a tuft of severed hair.\n\u0026ldquo;You see this? This is the old you. This is who you were day after day after day. But it\u0026rsquo;s gone now. \u0026lsquo;Cause this, this is the new you. Now you can be whoever you wanna be.\u0026rdquo;\nNadia and Horse hunker down for the night and Nadia respawns in the bathroom having frozen to death. Nadia goes to the shelter to keep an eye on Horse\u0026rsquo;s shoes. He warns her not to touch him while he sleeps because he\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;got reflexes.\u0026rdquo; Nadia prevents the theft. When Horse awakens the next morning he looks Nadia in the eye, announces that he wants to cut her hair, and trots out of the shelter without another word.\nHorse helps Nadia literally shed her old self, her baggage and trauma. The futility of life, especially life in the loop, suddenly takes a backseat to this simple selfless act of protecting Horse\u0026rsquo;s shoes.\nS01E04 Alan\u0026rsquo;s approach to the time loop is to attempt to control every aspect of his day. When he meets Nadia, he learns that his control was an illusion. Confronted with his own powerlessness and the futility of his actions, he begins to fall apart, culminating with his breaking a mirror.\nS01E05 This episode is largely about Nadia failing to make amends with John by meeting Lucy and Alan failing to figure out why Beatrice cheated on him. None of it is terribly relevant to the current topic.\nS01E06 Nadia and Alan are at a bar. Alan notices Nadia\u0026rsquo;s necklace.\nALAN: That\u0026rsquo;s pretty.\nNADIA: Oh, this, this was my mother\u0026rsquo;s. It\u0026rsquo;s a krugerrand. You know what that is?\nALAN: May— No. No, I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t.\nNADIA: It\u0026rsquo;s a South African gold bullion. It goes for about, uh, $1,500 an ounce.\nALAN: Whoa. Cool.\nNADIA: I told you my grandparents are Holocaust survivors, right?\nALAN: No, we basically just met. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about—\nNADIA: It\u0026rsquo;s not on you. Anyway, after the war, you know, most survivors were a little bit paranoid about putting their money in banks, so my grandparents acquired 150 of these babies, and then my mother, \u0026lsquo;cause shes a fucking piece of work, she spent them all except for this one.\n(NADIA steals ALAN\u0026rsquo;s shoes and takes them to the park.)\nNADIA: Hey. Hey, Horse. Hey, man. Uh\u0026hellip; Uh, Nadia. Yeah. It\u0026rsquo;s me, I\u0026rsquo;m your friend. You gave me a haircut.\nHORSE: I don\u0026rsquo;t know you.\nNADIA: All right, be cool, man. Look, look, look, what size are you?\nHORSE: What do you mean?\n(NADIA holds up the shoes.)\nHORSE: Come with me.\nNADIA: All right. Where the fuck are we going?\nHORSE: I got plants.\n(Cut to the two of them smoking and huffing glue)\nHORSE: I prefer casual acquaintances over closer relations, and strangers above everybody else, \u0026lsquo;cause humanity\u0026rsquo;s a fuck, man. I had this business partner once in the 90s when we were creating the dark web, and he got arrested because it was a scam and our government is a scam, and once I saw it was all just bullshit I just dropped out completely.\nNADIA: How do you know that you\u0026rsquo;re real?\nHORSE: Huh?\nNADIA: Do you think that we need people to be, like, witnesses?\nHORSE: I\u0026rsquo;m here. That\u0026rsquo;s where you know. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I lost everything. Technology, cryptocurrencies\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s all bullshit, man. You don\u0026rsquo;t need any of that stuff. The more stuff you accumulate, the more space you take up. You know, people can\u0026rsquo;t even pick me out of a lineup \u0026lsquo;cause they don\u0026rsquo;t remember me. I\u0026rsquo;m a shadow, man.\nNADIA: I think I\u0026rsquo;m a shadow now, too.\n(NADIA gives HORSE her necklace)\nHORSE: Is that real gold? Why?\nNADIA: It\u0026rsquo;s too heavy.\n— S01E06\nHorse teaches Nadia that things are immaterial. Wealth and possessions are nothing. The person in front of you, that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s real. And in response, she gives Horse the symbol of her resentment toward her mother. She sheds it as she did her hair three episodes ago.\nS01E07 This episodes follows each of our heroes as they try to tackle some of their lingering issues head-on. Alan goes to have a chat with Beatrice in which he seems to forgive both her and himself, freeing himself from the shackles of his pathetic past self. Nadia wrestles with flashbacks and the guilt of leaving her mother, confronts her self-punishing lifestyle, and tries to break the cycle by bringing Emily of New Moon to the diner.\nThe episode ends with a young Nadia asking her if she\u0026rsquo;s ready to let her die. Nadia previously let go of her resentment toward her mother. Now she has to let go of her younger self, the part of herself that can\u0026rsquo;t forgive her for betraying her mother and has her trapped in a guilt-induced spiral of self-destructive behavior.\nS01E08 The episode opens on a high note, as both our characters start their loops with a fully repopulated world. They both have many joyous and healing interactions as they try to find each other. It quickly becomes clear that they are in separate loops, each having reset to their original missed opportunity to save the other\u0026rsquo;s life.\nHorse primarily appears in Nadia\u0026rsquo;s version of the loop. Horse bequeaths Oatmeal to her on her way to the diner, and then later is proposed to by a drunk Alan. Horse tells Alan to follow him, much like he has done to Nadia in past loops. They arrive in a sort of alley with some other dirty kids, to whom Horse tells he\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;got another one\u0026rdquo;, and Horse offers him a joint(?), then asks Alan if he\u0026rsquo;s going to pay for it. Alan gives them all of his money, since he\u0026rsquo;s planning on killing himself at this point and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need it. At this point Nadia swoops in to rescue Alan, Horse shouts after her that they\u0026rsquo;re keeping his stuff, and Horse promptly puts on a horse head.\nHorse\u0026rsquo;s behavior here seems somewhat out of character. He seems to be taking advantage of Alan in his weakened state, borderline robbing him, and he has never shown anything resembling predatory behavior toward Nadia. It is possible that Horse recognized in Nadia a kindred spirit of sorts, someone who is no stranger to pain and brokenness. Alan, on the other hand, is a well-dressed gentleman who has, until today, had his life pretty together. Horse may be simply taking advantage of somebody he perceives to be of a higher class than himself, much like Robin Hood.\nHorse\u0026rsquo;s comment about having gotten another one is interesting. It could imply that Horse and his friends regularly rob drunk people, but I rather think that his statement has more to do with what immediately follows: the strange Halloween parade which they are all clearly preparing for. Horse dons his horse head as soon as Nadia and Alan leave. Horse taking all of Alan\u0026rsquo;s money may not have been malicious\u0026mdash;we\u0026rsquo;ve already seen how Horse feels about material wealth\u0026mdash;and is, in fact, reaching out to Alan. This may be Alan\u0026rsquo;s initiation into the parade.\nIn any case, the episode ends with a sort of Halloween parade lead by Horse. Both timelines \u0026ldquo;merge\u0026rdquo; upon this parade, both Nadia and Alan having corrected their mistakes. They are ready to move forward into whatever comes next.\nIn the United States, Halloween is mostly about candy, but this procession calls to mind other festivals of the dead such as Obon, Chuseok, or Día de los Muertos. In these festivals, the dead may roam the earth, visiting living family members. The living make offerings to the dead, sometimes out of respect, love, or honor, and sometimes to appease them and quiet their spirits. These festivals themselves have a sort of psychopompic function, transforming ritual action into spiritual energy for the benefit of the dead. This parade in particular bears a striking resemblance to the Wild Hunt of Odin, especially given Horse\u0026rsquo;s resemblance to Odin.\nThe showrunners disagree with me on this, but this scene has always struck me as Nadia and Alan breaking free of the purgatory of the time loop and moving into death proper, freed of the burdens of their traumas. But whether they are dead or not, Horse\u0026rsquo;s function throughout the season\u0026rsquo;s narrative has been one of spiritual transformation. He has been the unassuming guide showing the way to healing.\nReferences Anonymous. (n.d.). Völsunga Saga. https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1152/1152-h/1152-h.htm#link2HCH0001 Cooper, R. M. (1978).

He believed that Jesus was created ex nihilo, from nothing, the same way that the rest of Creation was. While he may have believed Jesus was the Son of God, and was divine himself, he was not himself God, or made up of the same substance as God.\nArius and his followers became known as Arians, and they would spark a centuries-long conflict in the early Christian Church.\nUnfortunately for Arius, Alexandria was also home to a deacon by the name of Athanasius. Athanasius would dedicate his life to stamping out the Arian Heresy.\nAthanasius was a strong believer in the consubstantiality of God and Christ. He argued that God and Jesus were not only made up of the same stuff, but were co-eternal and co-equal. Jesus was not created, but existed alongside and as a part of God from the very beginning.\nThe battle between Arius and Athanasius came to a head at the Council of Nicea in 325 CE, where Athanasius would succeed in persuading Church leadership to his view. Arius and his followers were successfully branded heretics. Still, popular support for Arianism was strong, and its supporters included Emperor Constantine the Great. It would take several more decades for the early Church to fully stamp out the Arian Heresy.\nThe Council of Nicea was not only important for what it condemned, but for what it proclaimed. Out of the Council emerged two important cornerstones of world Christendom: the elevation of the books of John and Revelation, and the writing of the Nicene Creed.\nContrary to popular belief, the Council of Nicea was not responsible for the canonization of the Christian Bible. The Roman Catholic Church would not declare an official canon until fifty years later at the Council of Rome in 382 CE, and most of the books adopted were already widely accepted and circulated throughout the early Church.\nIn 140 CE, Marcion of Sinope drew up a list of texts which he considered canonical. Marcion\u0026rsquo;s list included a good deal of the present-day New Testament canon, including Luke, Galatians, I and II Corinthians, Romans, I and II Thessalonians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon, and Philippians.\nIn roughly 180 CE, Irenaeus advocated for the four-gospel canon and drew on all of the books in the present-day New Testament except Philemon, II Peter, III John, and Jude in his treatise Against Heresies.\nBy 200 CE, Origen of Alexandria was (probably) using the same list of 27 books that we have today.\nCanonization took place gradually over centuries, and was influenced by what early Christians were actually reading and circulating. It was not imposed on the Church by its leaders, but was formulated from the bottom up before being officially accepted.\nThe Council of Nicea did, however, put to rest much of the early Church\u0026rsquo;s discomfort with the books of John and Revelation. The Gospel of John is the only Gospel not to follow the Synoptic formula and expresses many ideas which seem to align with gnosticism, another heresy the early Church worked hard to destroy. Revelation is a bizarre revenge fantasy about Jesus returning to lead his people in violent revolt against Rome, disguised as apocalypse literature (a genre of literature in which readers \u0026ldquo;in the know\u0026rdquo; were expected to unpack dense metaphors to uncover the true meaning of the text).\nThey hardly seem to fit in with the rest of the New Testament canon, but Athanasius fought to defend them and to elevate them to stand on equal footing with the other books. They were perfect weapons against Arianism.\nThe Gospel of John begins, \u0026ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\u0026hellip; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\u0026rdquo; Clearly Jesus was not created, but is co-eternal and co-equal with God! Likewise, the Book of Revelation is filled to the brim with colorful illustrations of Christ\u0026rsquo;s divine nature and authority.\nSo the Church leadership at the Council of Nicea reached consensus regarding the Arian Heresy and had Scripture to support their stance. For the sake of the unity of the Church, and to combat the spread of Arianism and other heretical ideas, they formulated the Nicene Creed.\nWe believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible.\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father [the only-begotten; that is, of the essence of the Father, God of God,] Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;\nBy whom all things were made [both in heaven and on earth];\nWho for us men, and for our salvation, came down and was incarnate and was made man;\nHe suffered, and the third day he rose again, ascended into heaven;\nFrom thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.\nAnd in the Holy Ghost.\n[But those who say: 'There was a time when he was not;' and 'He was not before he was made;' and 'He was made out of nothing,' or 'He is of another substance' or 'essence,' or 'The Son of God is created,' or 'changeable,' or 'alterable'\u0026mdash; they are condemned by the holy catholic and apostolic Church.]\nThus was Christian orthodoxy born. Or, at least, codified.\nOrthodoxy and orthopraxy Orthodoxy, Greek for \u0026ldquo;correct belief\u0026rdquo;, has been baked into the fabric of the Western worldview for millennia. Most aspects of an individual\u0026rsquo;s identity are defined by belief. A Christian believes in the divinity, death, and resurrection of Christ. An atheist believes that there is no God and that science and reason are the key to living a fulfilling moral life. A Democrat believes in using the power of government to aid and uplift marginalized groups. Republicans believe in individuals\u0026rsquo; freedom to do as they please with their hard-earned resources without government interference. Some trans people believe that their gender is determined by their internal alignment with socially defined gender roles. Some gay people believe that their same-sex attraction is an intrinsic part of their identity as much as is their height, shoe size, or love of pizza (I am assuming, correctly, that loving pizza is a universal constant).\nOften, I am asked what Jews believe. Sometimes the question is asked by somebody who knows little about Judaism and is hoping to get a general sense for what Judaism is all about. Sometimes the question is more specific: \u0026ldquo;What do Jews believe about such and such?\u0026rdquo; Regardless, my answer is always the same, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Which Jews, and when, and where?\u0026rdquo;\nUnlike so many Western religions, Judaism is not orthodoxic. Judaism is orthopraxic; it emphasizes correct action over correct belief. That makes talking about Jewish beliefs a little tricky.\nIn general, Jews believe in one God. We say the shema, a prayer declaring the Oneness of God, multiple times a day. However, not all Jews believe in God. Many Jews lost their faith in God in the face of the Holocaust, and they are still Jewish. Some humanistic and secular Jews may not believe in God, and they are still Jewish. Some Jews are pantheists, believing that God is not a distinct entity but that all things are God, and they are still Jewish. I can generally count on a Chabadnik to have some tefillin I can borrow, but I can\u0026rsquo;t as easily predict his thoughts, feelings, or beliefs beyond \u0026ldquo;Yes, you should wrap tefillin.\u0026rdquo;\nThere have been some attempts to capture in writing the spirit of Jewish beliefs. The famous medieval rabbi Maimonides wrote one such list of 13 Principles of Faith. However, we are pretty sure his list was an attempt to explain Judaism to non-Jews in the hopes that they would ease up a little on the Jewish community. It is not widely known or accepted by the majority of world Jewry, and is of extremely limited actual usefulness.\nJudaism as a religion is, instead, focused on observing the mitzvot, acts of religious observance commanded by God in the Torah. Some mitzvot are positive: you should give charity, or you should pray the shema before you go to sleep. Some mitzvot are negative: you should not work on the Sabbath, or you should not eat pork. There aren\u0026rsquo;t any mitzvot telling Jews what they should or should not believe in, only what they should or should not do.\nA non-Jew said to Rabbi Hillel, \u0026ldquo;I will convert to Judaism if you can teach me the whole of the Torah while I stand on one foot.\u0026rdquo;\nRabbi Hillel replied, \u0026ldquo;What is hateful to you, do not do to another. That is the whole of the Torah. The rest is commentary. Go and study.\u0026rdquo;\nRabbi Akiva added, \u0026ldquo;Love the other as you love yourself.\u0026rdquo;\nThe most repeated commandment in the Hebrew Bible is to be kind to the strangers, for you were strangers in Egypt and you know how it feels to be oppressed.\nOf course, not all Jews observe the mitzvot, or observe the mitzvot to various degrees. Plenty of Jews eat bacon or go to work on Friday, and they are still Jews. A child born to Jewish parents and raised in a Jewish household who chooses not to believe in God or to observe a single mitzvot is still a Jew.\nAnd if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, what even is a Jew? Perhaps what makes a Jew is their genetic heritage\u0026mdash;but converts can become Jews regardless of their genetic makeup. Maybe a Jew is simply somebody who observes a set of cultural practices, like eating matzo and lox\u0026mdash;but matzo and lox are Ashkenazic customs, and Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews have their own, distinct sets of customs. The definition of a Jew gets muddier and muddier as you go!\nEthno-religions Here we come up against another limit of the Western worldview: the separation of the concepts of ethnicity, culture, and religion. Judaism is an ethno-religious group. Judaism is not merely an ethnic group, set of cultural practices, or religion. It is all three at once, with all three aspects being inextricable parts of the whole.\nAll Jews are descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (or descendants of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Judah, which is about as far back as we can historically verify). Many are genetic descendants. Many married into the family. Some were adopted into the family through conversion. Although world Jewry has been broken up and scattered across the world, developing into a number of distinct Diaspora cultures, we are all still family. The food we eat might have different flavors or colors, but we observe the kashrut laws. We pray the same prayers in the same ancestral tongue. We observe the same Shabbat, read the same Torah, and argue in the same Talmudic idiom. As many differences as there are between different Jewish communities, there are more similarities. In this way, Judaism can be thought of as an ethnic group whose cultural heritage includes a common religious practice. In other words, Judaism is an ethno-religion.\nNo wonder it\u0026rsquo;s so much harder to convert to Judaism than many other religions! In order to become a Christian, one need only accept Jesus as the Christ and profess their faith. In order to convert to Islam, one need only profess their belief in Allah and the Prophet Muhammad. There are religious and cultural practices that one might be expected to adopt after conversion, but they are not crucial to religious identity.\nConverting to Judaism, however, requires a period of study supervised by a Rabbi, and the approval of a Rabbinical Court (beit din). The beit din might ask about your beliefs, but they will ask much more about your understanding of Jewish history, ritual, culture, practice, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s less like converting to a religion, and more like seeking citizenship in a new country.\nOf course, Jewish identity has become increasingly more complicated since the establishment of the political State of Israel in 1948. A detailed discussion of Zionism and Israel is beyond the scope of the present essay. Various strands of Zionist thought have sought to replace Jewish religious identity with a secular, nationalist one, a strategy which the Israeli government has largely adopted. The Israeli government has also, in various ways, attempted to exercise control over Jewish religious life. Likewise, some religious sects have exerted disproportionate influence on Israeli policy. Discussion about Israel\u0026rsquo;s role in Jewish life and identity has been ubiquitous, and sometimes heated, since the October 7th Hamas attack and Israel\u0026rsquo;s military response; and, although the historical and political situation in the Levant is incredibly complicated, a sharp increase in global antisemitism and violent attacks against Diaspora Jews, has made taking a stance on Israel a matter of public safety for Diaspora communities.\nJewish identity, like all identities, is complicated. It is especially so when approached from a Western, predominantly Christian worldview. We live in an age when social media amplifies the most alarmist and vitriolic opinions and extremist populist movements are sweeping across the United States and Europe. I hope that this essay will serve to foster some understanding between Americans and the Jews among them.\nRevision History 2024-04-25: Original posting.
