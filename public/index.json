[{"content":"This post is in progress and/or possibly abandoned.\nIntroduction This essay hopes to establish the psychopompic fuction of Horse, the enigmatic homeless man in the 2019 Netflix series Russian Doll. This essay treats the first season as a self-contained standalone story.\nWhat Is a Psychopomp? psychopomp (plural psychopomps)\n(religion) A spirit, deity, person, etc., who guides the souls of the dead to the afterlife. (Wiktionary, 2024) A psychopomp ferries the souls of the dead from this world to the next. The Egyptian Anubis, the Germanic Wotan/Woden/Odin, and our own Grim Reaper — death itself personified — fulfill this psychopompic function.\nSigmund rose up, and sorrowed nigh to death over him; then he took the corpse in his arms and fared away to the wood, and went till he came to a certain firth; and there he saw a man in a little boat; and that man asked if he would be wafted by him over the firth, and he said yea thereto; but so little was the boat, that they might not all go in it at once, so the corpse was first laid therein, while Sigmund went by the firth-side. But therewith the boat and the man therein vanished away from before Sigmund\u0026rsquo;s eyes. (Volsunga Saga, Ch. X)\nAnimals, too, may serve psychopompic functions. Odin was accompanied by two ravens, and, indeed, Germanic stories often set the scene for bloodshed by indicating the presence of hungry ravens and wolves on the soon-to-be battlefield, eagerly awaiting their next meal. This connection suggests that the above definition is perhaps too limited in scope. Carrion animals do not guide the souls of the dead, but rather guide the corpses of the dead in their transformation from useless, decaying matter. Psychopomps are functionally transformational.\nVultures orient us toward death as material transformation in a way that cares little for its cause\u0026hellip; The vulture is a species that the ancient Greeks identified as a psychopomp — an animal guide to the other side, a greeter at death\u0026rsquo;s door, a harbinger of demise. (Gray, 2017)\nIf the vulture, raven, and wolf are psychopomps in the material sense, transforming dead matter, the function of the deity is spiritual transformation. Narratively this takes the form of a metaphysical journey. Charon ferries the soul across the River Styx. The Valkyrie carries the slain to Valhalla. But if we peek behind the metaphor, we can speculate that this spiritual transformation is one which prepares the soul for whatever comes next.\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s dialogue, Meno, opens with this question by Meno: \u0026ldquo;Can you tell me Socrates — is virtue something that can be taught? Or does it come by practice? Or is it neither teaching nor practice that gives it to a man but natural aptitude or something else?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip; Whatever else the question entails properly as a consideration, it is a question about change: Can one go from a condition of being unlearned to one of being taught?\u0026hellip;\nLet us use one of Plato\u0026rsquo;s own examples from the Republic, the allegory of the cave\u0026hellip; Those who have managed to be freed from their fetters ascertain by the act of turning around from the wall where the shadows play that there is a source or a cause of the shadows. They can give themselves an adequate account (logos) of what they had seen, that the world of appearances is what they had known, and that world is henceforth known in terms of something else. When they make their way up out of the cave, coming to the surface of earth they — by practice now — are able to recognize their own and other images reflected in water by the light of the Sun\u0026hellip; But what have they been taught? And by whom have they been taught?\u0026hellip;\nThe allegory, which I am so briefly sketching here does not end with the emergence upon the surface of earth of those hitherto bound. They go back down into the cave to show, or to teach or to invite into the practice they have learned, those who remain there bound. There is, then, a very important sense in which such \u0026ldquo;teachers\u0026rdquo; are a kind of \u0026ldquo;psychopomp\u0026rdquo; leading the fettered soul from darkness to light\u0026hellip;\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s psychopomps (my term, not Plato\u0026rsquo;s) in his allegory of the cave show others where they have been and how they got there, even though they themselves do not know fully how they got there or even, indeed, where they arrived. They invite others into an activity. They invite others into a functioning freely — functioning freely, albeit alongside a dialectic (dia-logic) that is a partial account of what is happening to them. (Cooper, 1978)\nIt is impossible to know, and pointless to speculate, how accurately the allegory of the cave applies to death, but the point remains that we can think of posthumous education as part of the role of the psychopomp. The psychopomp invites the deceased into the activity of death, whatever that may entail.\nRussian Doll S01E01 The tale tells that great fires were made endlong the hall, and the great tree aforesaid stood midmost thereof; withal folk say that, whenas men sat by the fires in the evening, a certain man came into the hall unknown of aspect to all men; and suchlike array he had, that over him was a spotted cloak, and he was bare-foot, and had linen-breeches knit tight even unto the bone, and he had a sword in his hand as he went up to the Branstock, and a slouched hat upon his head: huge he was, and seeming-ancient, and one-eyed. (Volsunga Saga, Ch. III)\nWhen we first meet Horse, Nadia is leaving her birthday party with Mike. She sees Horse across the street, leaning against a fence, asking passersby if they have a quarter. Mike sees her staring and asks, \u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; to which Nadia replies, \u0026ldquo;I think I know that guy.\u0026rdquo;\nLater interactions with Horse will establish that she does not, in fact, know that guy.\nThe camera turns back around to Horse who is getting a light from another passerby. He takes a long drag on his cigarette while he stands barefoot, staring directly at the camera.\n(Russian Doll, S01E01)\nMinutes later, Nadia sees her missing cat, steps into the street to retrieve him, is hit by a cab, and dies for the first time.\nIn the next loop, Nadia sees him again at the same intersection.\nNADIA: I think I know this guy. Hey! Do I know you?\nHORSE: What?\nNADIA: Do we know each other?\nHORSE: Fuck off. (Russian Doll, S01E01)\nWe next see Horse in her next loop, playfully swinging on the fence. It is very cute.\nS01E02 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. (Ecclesiastes 1:2, KJV)\nUtter futility!—said Koheleth—\nUtter futility! All is futile! (Ecclesiastes 1:2, JPS, 1985)\n\u0026ldquo;Vanity\u0026rdquo; is an interesting translation choice. The Hebrew word is \u0026ldquo;hevel\u0026rdquo;, breath or vapor. Hevel is like a mist. You can see it, but when you reach out to grasp it your hand comes away empty. It is the illusion of substance, the promise of fulfillment. Kohelet laments that all is hevel because he has tried all things, virtue and vice alike, and found it all as impermanent as the morning fog.\nAs Nadia struggles to confront her (im)mortality, she throws herself fully into her birthday party. We see a montage of heavy drinking and drug use until Nadia passes out on the couch. Hevel, hevel! All is hevel!\nS01E03 Nadia is wandering drunk through the park.\nHORSE: What\u0026rsquo;s on your head? I said, what\u0026rsquo;s on your head? Is that a wig or a hat?\nNADIA: Where\u0026rsquo;s your shoes, man?\nHORSE: Mmm, someone stole them last night at the shelter, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going back there, not ever. I don\u0026rsquo;t sleep among thieves.\nNADIA: Man, someone stole your shoes? Hey, what the fuck is going on in America, huh? What\u0026rsquo;s your name, do I know you?\nHORSE: No, you can call me Horse, if you want.\nNADIA: Alright, Horse, I\u0026rsquo;m Nadia. You want some?\nHORSE: Can I tell you something?\nNADIA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I\u0026rsquo;m, mm, y\u0026rsquo;know, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell me anything, you know, if I was you, because I\u0026rsquo;m just not the kind of person that you tell secrets to. Uh, I\u0026rsquo;m the abyss.\nThey both laugh uproariously.\nHORSE: I wanna cut your hair. (Russian Doll, S01E03)\nNadia immediately agrees. As Horse prepares his tools, Nadia jokes, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re gonna kill me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can change your mind.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; Horse says, brandishing his scissors.\nCut to post-haircut. Horse holds up a tuft of severed hair.\nHORSE: You see this? This is the old you. This is who you were day after day after day. But it\u0026rsquo;s gone now. \u0026lsquo;Cause this, this is the new you. Now you can be whoever you wanna be. (Russian Doll, S01E03)\nNadia and Horse hunker down for the night and Nadia respawns in the bathroom having frozen to death. Nadia goes to the shelter to keep an eye on Horse\u0026rsquo;s shoes. He warns her not to touch him while he sleeps because he\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;got reflexes.\u0026rdquo; Nadia prevents the theft. When Horse awakens the next morning he looks Nadia in the eye, announces that he wants to cut her hair, and trots out of the shelter without another word.\nS01E04 Alan\u0026rsquo;s approach to the time loop is to attempt to control every aspect of his day. When he meets Nadia, he learns that his control was an illusion. Confronted with his own powerlessness and the futility of his actions, he begins to fall apart, culminating with his breaking a mirror.\nS01E05 This episode is largely about Nadia failing to make amends with John by meeting Lucy and Alan failing to figure out why Beatrice cheated on him. None of it is terribly relevant to the current topic.\nS01E06 Nadia and Alan are at a bar. Alan notices Nadia\u0026rsquo;s necklace.\nALAN: That\u0026rsquo;s pretty.\nNADIA: Oh, this, this was my mother\u0026rsquo;s. It\u0026rsquo;s a krugerrand. You know what that is?\nALAN: May— No. No, I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t.\nNADIA: It\u0026rsquo;s a South African gold bullion. It goes for about, uh, $1,500 an ounce.\nALAN: Whoa. Cool.\nNADIA: I told you my grandparents are Holocaust survivors, right?\nALAN: No, we basically just met. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about—\nNADIA: It\u0026rsquo;s not on you. Anyway, after the war, you know, most survivors were a little bit paranoid about putting their money in banks, so my grandparents acquired 150 of these babies, and then my mother, \u0026lsquo;cause shes a fucking piece of work, she spent them all except for this one.\nNadia steals Alan\u0026rsquo;s shoes and takes them to the park.\nNADIA: Hey. Hey, Horse. Hey, man. Uh\u0026hellip; Uh, Nadia. Yeah. It\u0026rsquo;s me, I\u0026rsquo;m your friend. You gave me a haircut.\nHORSE: I don\u0026rsquo;t know you.\nNADIA: All right, be cool, man. Look, look, look, what size are you? HORSE: What do you mean?\n(NADIA holds up the shoes.)\nHORSE: Come with me.\nNADIA: All right. Where the fuck are we going?\nHORSE: I got plants.\n(Cut to the two of them smoking and huffing glue)\nHORSE: I prefer casual acquaintances over closer relations, and strangers above everybody else, \u0026lsquo;cause humanity\u0026rsquo;s a fuck, man. I had this business partner once in the 90s when we were creating the dark web, and he got arrested because it was a scam and our government is a scam, and once I saw it was all just bullshit I just dropped out completely.\nNADIA: How do you know that you\u0026rsquo;re real?\nHORSE: Huh?\nNADIA: Do you think that we need people to be, like, witnesses?\nHORSE: I\u0026rsquo;m here. That\u0026rsquo;s where you know. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I lost everything. Technology, cryptocurrencies\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s all bullshit, man. You don\u0026rsquo;t need any of that stuff. The more stuff you accumulate, the more space you take up. You know, people can\u0026rsquo;t even pick me out of a lineup \u0026lsquo;cause they don\u0026rsquo;t remember me. I\u0026rsquo;m a shadow, man.\nNADIA: I think I\u0026rsquo;m a shadow now, too.\n(NADIA gives HORSE her necklace)\nHORSE: Is that real gold? Why?\nNADIA: It\u0026rsquo;s too heavy. (Russian Doll, S01E06)\nHorse teaches Nadia that things are immaterial. Wealth and possessions are nothing. The person in front of you, that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s real. And in response, she gives Horse the symbol of her resentment toward her mother. She sheds it as she did her hair three episodes ago.\nS01E07 S01E08 (Arbo, 1872)\n(Russian Doll, S01E08)\nReferences Anonymous. (n.d.).

It would be reckless to suggest that Ballad truly precedes the main trilogy in thought, that Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s experiences with Lucy Gray inform his interactions with Katniss. On the contrary, Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s interactions with Katniss inform his interactions with Lucy Gray. The prequel novel draws on the material in the main trilogy and recontextualizes it to give the main trilogy a level of depth that it previously lacked.\nStylistically, Ballad is far removed from the main trilogy. The trilogy is young adult fiction through and through. Told in first-person present, we are given intimate access to Katniss\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and feelings. Her youth, inexperience, and naïveté color our experience: we do not always see the world reliably because she does not. Ballad is written third person. We see glimpses of Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s thoughts only when the narrator allows it, and he is no more reliable than Katniss. We must watch Coriolanus from a distance, analyzing his words and deeds to discover his true thoughts.\nIn this essay, I contend that Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s youth is characterized by an internal and external struggle between good and evil. Coriolanus was not born the dictatorial Coriolanus Snow we know from the trilogy, nor is he forced into that role by purely external or environmental influence. Rather, in the mode of Greek tragedy, he forces himself into this role through the culmination of his own choices. These choices are the result of an unconscious proclivity toward selfish destructiveness.\nMajor themes The yetzer hara Judaism posits the existence of two opposing forces in the human psyche: the yetzer hatov and the yetzer hara, or the Good Inclination and the Evil Inclination respectively.\nWhile \u0026ldquo;good and evil\u0026rdquo; are acceptable rough translations of tov and ra, the English terms carry with them a significant amount of cultural baggage and connotations which do not necessarily agree with the Hebrew usages in the Hebrew Bible. A detailed examination is beyond the scope of the present essay, but we will adopt the translations \u0026ldquo;good, beneficial [to the community], constructive\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;evil, useless or detrimental [to the community], destructive\u0026rdquo;.\nThe two inclinations constantly contend with each other. The yetzer hara is especially insidious:\nSurely, if you do right,\nThere is uplift.\nBut if you do not do right\nSin couches at the door;\nIts urge is toward you,\nYet you can be its master. (The Contemporary Torah, 2006, Gen. 4:7)\nThe power of the yetzer hara is on full display in the story of the Flood in Genesis. God wipes out all of humanity, save Noah and his family, in response to their rampant violence and injustice. Yet, God immediately repents of this act. Even God is powerless to defeat the yetzer hara:\n[God] smelled the pleasing odor, and [God] resolved: “Never again will I doom the earth because of humankind, since the devisings of the human mind are evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living being, as I have done. (The Contemporary Torah, 2006, Gen. 8:21)\nThis is not to say that the yetzer hara is all-powerful. Gen 4:7 states unequivocally that \u0026ldquo;you can be its master.\u0026rdquo; It is, however, a constant and unending struggle:\nIncidental to the verse, “Tremble, and do not sin,” the Gemara mentions that Rabbi Levi bar Ḥama said that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: One should always incite his good inclination against his evil inclination, i.e., that one must constantly struggle so that his evil inclination does not lead him to transgression, as it is stated: \u0026ldquo;Tremble, and do not sin.\u0026rdquo;\nIf one succeeds and subdues his evil inclination, excellent, but if he does not succeed in subduing it, he should study Torah, as alluded to in the verse: “Say to your heart\u0026hellip; (Koren Talmud Bavli, 2019, Berakhot 5a:2)\nThe yetzer hara can be overcome by, for example, constant study and meditation on Torah, that is, immersive study and meditation on the good.\nThese two impulses, their influence over man\u0026rsquo;s actions and his struggle against or submission to them, provide a conceptual framework for Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s moral development.\nTigris and Dr. Gaul Dr. Gaul is a flat, static character. She is the representation of an idea, a certain approach to political philosophy and human nature. She does not change over the course of the narrative. Her function in the narrative is, essentially, to be the primary driving force in developing Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s worldview. She is the physical embodiment of the yetzer hara.\nThere are many characters who influence Coriolanus more positively than Dr. Gaul, but there is one character who, like Dr. Gaul, is relatively flat, static, and an unambiguously good influence. If any character can represent Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s yetzer hatov, it is Tigris.\nAn examination of these two\u0026rsquo;s interactions with Coriolanus and the ways in which Coriolanus responds to and integrates their influence into his worldview and actions provide a window into his moral decline. They show Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s transformation from Coryo into President Snow.\nSejanus and Lucy Gray If Tigris and Dr. Gaul are the angel and devil on Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s shoulders, Sejanus and Lucy Gray are the ultimately unfortunate victims of Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s decisions. Sejanus and Lucy Gray are more complex characters than Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s moral guides and have their own arcs, but in the context of Ballad\u0026rsquo;s Coriolanus-centric narrative, they serve as Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s foils. Sejanus is Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s opposite in nearly every way: District born, new money, and sympathetic to the Districts\u0026rsquo; suffering. Lucy Gray contrasts Coriolanus more subtly. She is everything that Coriolanus wishes to be: free, uninhibited, confident enough not to care what others think of her. It is precisely these qualities which cause Coriolanus to seek to control, dominate, and eventually despise her.\nOn impulse Ballad\u0026rsquo;s third person limited viewpoint gives us glimpses into Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s thought processes. Coriolanus is analytical to a fault, always weighing the effects his words and deeds have on those around him, and especially on their perception of him. He tends to think and tread carefully. He is also a master of the art of retroactively rationalizing his behavior and that of others. This combination of traits makes him an outrageously unreliable narrator. He projects his own biases and assumptions about human nature on others uncritically, and consistently re-imagines the world around him to establish the rightness of his actions post facto.\nThis makes Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s internal monologue an unreliable tool for analyzing his actual beliefs. Instead, the reader must wrestle with Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s ever-changing understanding of his present moment. Objective fact eludes us, and we come away not with Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s thoughts but his methods of thinking. We are invited into Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience of reality.\nThere are, however, a handful of moments which Coriolanus does not interpret for us, when he acts without premeditation. It is when Coriolanus acts without impulse that we get the clearest look into the values and beliefs at the center of his character.\nMinor themes The Covey and the Citadel Songbirds and snakes are prominent symbols in the novel. The Covey and the Citadel both employ each of them in different ways. Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s responses to symbols and those who employ them provide additional clues about his worldview.\nCrassus, his mother, and the Grandma\u0026rsquo;am Coriolanus feels tremendous pressure to live up to his family name as a Snow, despite his precarious relationship with his predecessors. The memory of his mother brings him comfort, but he sees in her an example of vulnerability and weakness. His relationship with his father was strained, but Crassus was a war hero and a source of inspiration. Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s internal conflict is, in part, an imaginary conflict between his mother and his father.\nNor can we ignore the fact of his having been raised by the Grandma\u0026rsquo;am. No doubt, much of the obligation Coriolanus feels toward the Snow name is the result of the Grandma\u0026rsquo;am\u0026rsquo;s expectations of him. The naive childhood worldview and politics he holds at the beginning of the novel are a blend of postwar trauma and Grandma\u0026rsquo;am\u0026rsquo;s peculiar brand racism and classism.\nA close reading With these themes in mind, we will embark on a close reading of the text in the hopes of mapping out the evolution of Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s core beliefs and moral decline.\nPart 1: Establishing a baseline Only his cousin\u0026rsquo;s cleverness with a needle had saved him so far. (Collins, 2023, p. 3)\nThe novel opens immediately with Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s insecurities about the fallen state of the Snow family. He is less concerned about the family\u0026rsquo;s actual poverty (perhaps because, as a student, there is little he can do to remedy it) than with keeping up appearances. Tigris is essential to the deception upon which Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s self-esteem rests.\nEvery meal, she\u0026rsquo;d rattle on about the Snows\u0026rsquo; legendary grandeur, even when their fare consisted of watery bean soup and stale crackers\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;When Coriolanus is president\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; everything from the rickety Capitol air force to the exorbitant price of pork chops would be magically corrected. (p. 8)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s uncertain how far back \u0026ldquo;every meal\u0026rdquo; goes, but it is clear that Coriolanus has long been steeped in stories of the Snows\u0026rsquo; glory days. Coriolanus seems to begrudge these tales. He may consider them to be an indication of a state of denial, perhaps dementia setting in, or perhaps a simple refusal to accept the material reality of the present.\nThe Grandma\u0026rsquo;am has high hopes for Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s future. Tigris, who has foregone University and brings in little money, is unlikely to be able to single-handedly drag the Snows out of poverty. That burden falls to Coriolanus. The Grandma\u0026rsquo;am does not stop there, however. She expects Coriolanus to rise to the highest political office in the Capitol, and to miraculously solve all the Capitol\u0026rsquo;s problems too! This is a heavy burden of expectation to place on an eighteen-year-old boy, especially one whose constant hunger makes such a dream seem like a ludicrous impossibility.\nHe noticed the lilac circles under her golden brown eyes\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;When was the last time you slept?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m fine. I ate the potato skins. They say that\u0026rsquo;s where the vitamins are anyway. And today\u0026rsquo;s the reaping, so it\u0026rsquo;s practically a holiday!\u0026rdquo; she said cheerfully.\n\u0026ldquo;Not at Fabricia\u0026rsquo;s,\u0026rdquo; he said\u0026hellip; Tigris would spend the day waiting hand and food on her employer and her motley crew of guests\u0026hellip; Tomorrow, nursing them through hangovers, would be worse. (p. 8)\nTigris fixes Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s shirt dilemma at great cost to her own wellbeing. She loses an entire night of sleep before what are sure to be a grueling two days of labor at her abusive job, pulling through on nothing but potato skins. She insists that she will be fine to protect Coriolanus.\n\u0026ldquo;It does look elegant. You know what her roses mean to her. Thank her.\u0026rdquo; (p. 12)\nThe narrative does not say whether Coriolanus would have thanked the Grandma\u0026rsquo;am otherwise. Her prompting may imply that he would not have. Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s tendency to carefully manipulate those around him imply that he might have. Either way, Tigris is here literally functioning as the angel on Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s shoulder.\nIt was not the shield that caught Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s attention but Sejanus\u0026rsquo;s outfit\u0026hellip; The ensemble was stylish, brand-new, and smelling of money. War profiteering, to be exact\u0026hellip; The Plinths now enjoyed privileges that the oldest, most powerful families had earned over generations\u0026hellip;\nFor Coriolanus, the Plinths and their kind were a threat to all he held dear\u0026hellip; It was particularly vexing because the bulk of the Snow family fortune had also been invested in munitions\u0026hellip; The center of the Capitol\u0026rsquo;s military manufacturing had shifted to District 2 and fallen right into the Plinths\u0026rsquo; laps. (pp. 16-17)\nSejanus\u0026rsquo;s outfit is the opposite of Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s. Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s shirt is old and was barely made presentable in time. Sejanus\u0026rsquo;s is brand new. Coriolanus has lived in the shadow of the legend of the Snow family name. The Plinths, new money, are enjoying the privileges which the Snows have lost. Coriolanus is keenly aware of this.\nCoriolanus views the Plinths as a threat. To Coriolanus, Sejanus is a usurper, taking for himself what is rightfully the Snows\u0026rsquo;. The fact that the Plinths made their fortune in the same industry that once made the Snows theirs rubs salt in the wound. Sejanus being Distict born is a direct threat to Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s sense of hereditary entitlement, which he seemed to resent mere pages ago but which he seems to have accepted as one of his core beliefs.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not really. But only because she hasn\u0026rsquo;t thought of it,\u0026rdquo; said Coriolanus, seesawing between disdain and camaraderie. (p. 19)\nA gentleman of good breeding must always present himself amicably, so Coriolanus jabs at Sejanus in the most passive-aggressive semi-self-depracating way imaginable. We will see Coriolanus keep up this seesawing as his opinions and attitudes toward Sejanus vacillate over the course of their relationship.\nMa? Was Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s place about to be usurped by someone who referred to his mother as \u0026ldquo;Ma\u0026rdquo;? (p. 20)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s bad enough for Sejanus to be District born in theory. His blatant disregard for Capitol etiquette is the cherry on the sandwich, and a clear indication of Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s blatant classist prejudices.\n\u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; he asked. \u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you happy? District Two, the boy — that\u0026rsquo;s the pick of the litter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You forget. I\u0026rsquo;m part of that litter,\u0026rdquo; said Sejanus hoarsley.\nCoriolanus let that sink in. So ten years in the Capitol and the privileged life it provided had been wasted on Sejanus. He still thought of himself as a district citizen. Sentimental nonsense.\nSejanus\u0026rsquo;s forehead creased in consternation. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure my father requested it. He\u0026rsquo;s always trying to get my mind right.\u0026rdquo;\nNo doubt, though Coriolanus. Old Strabo Plinth\u0026rsquo;s deep pockets and influence were respected if his lineage was not. And while the mentorships were supposedly based on merit, strings clearly had been pulled.\nCoriolanus makes two assumptions here, both wrong. The first is that the boys are obviously more likely to win the Hunger Games because they are naturally stronger than girls. Even if we make allowances for the pre-bombing arena making the Hunger Games largely a close-quarters bloodbath, his sexism is questionable at best, and indicative of his attitude toward women in general. The second is that Sejanus cares as much about winning as Coriolanus does. Coriolanus fails to remember that Sejanus is from District Two and may know his tribute personally, and fails to imagine that anybody would have moral reservations about the Hunger Games at all. We might conclude that Capitol citizens may find the Hunger Games distasteful but do not fundamentally condemn them; they are ugly but necessary and just. Or perhaps Coriolanus is projecting his own attitude onto his peers.\nCoriolanus\u0026rsquo;s resentment toward Sejanus only grows when he realizes his usurper isn\u0026rsquo;t even grateful for the privileged position he occupies. Sejanus takes his wealth and status for granted while Coriolanus starves.\nWe know little to nothing about Sejanus\u0026rsquo;s academic record, so it is unclear what Coriolanus means by \u0026ldquo;merit\u0026rdquo;. What is clear is Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s sense of entitlement. He is entitled to the best tribute, and he is entitled to the recognition of his peers and teachers.\nLucy Gray Baird stood upright in a dress made of rainbow ruffles, now raggedy but once fancy. (p. 24)\nLucy Gray\u0026rsquo;s dress matches Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s shirt, once an indication of prosperity, now stained and tattered. Crassus\u0026rsquo;s old shirt, however, was part of his military ensemble, and has been redone to mask the Snows\u0026rsquo; poverty. Lucy Gray\u0026rsquo;s mother\u0026rsquo;s dress is almost gaudy and meant for performance and entertainment. Despite its deteriorated state, it is deceptive in its own right: what is a performance if not an elaborate lie?\nCoriolanus scanned the crowd and felt a spark of hope. His long shot of a tribute, his throwaway, his insult had captured the Capitol\u0026rsquo;s attention\u0026hellip; With his help, perhaps she could keep it, and he could turn disgrace into a respectable showing. (p. 25)\nCoriolanus\u0026rsquo;s interest in Lucy Gray begins and ends with himself. He sees her as an object, disposable, first as an insult given him by Dean Highbottom, then as a tool for his own gain. There is an implicit assumption that Lucy Gray will not win the Hunger Games. Her death is a given. This may play into Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s thinking of her as less than human. The Districts are savage rebels, murderers, Lucy Gray is not a victim but just recompense, and if she will be dead soon anyway, he need not dwell too deeply on the moral implications of his thinking.\nShe managed to blow a kiss before they were on her. \u0026ldquo;My friends call me Lucy Gray — I hope you will, too!\u0026rdquo; she called out. (p. 29)\nLucy Gray shares Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s desire to have some control over how others view her. Here, we might conclude that her manipulation is an innocent facet of her role as a performer. The audience is aware of the conceit in a way that Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s peers are not. We will see how this desire develops later on.\nThe cousins never spoke of it, even to each other, but it was burned into Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s memory\u0026hellip; the absolute horror of realizing that he, too, could now be viewed as edible. (p. 32)\nQuite a trauma for one so young. Coriolanus learned early on the savagery that humanity is capable of, and this no doubt defined his growth into a paranoid and self-serving young adult. We have seen Tigris take this as a call to action to be generous and compassionate, to prevent such atrocities from being necessary. It is tragic that they never spoke of it—perhaps Coriolanus would have been able to process the trauma more effectively—but Tigris, a child herself, could hardly be blamed.\nIt fell to eight-year-old Tigris to boil the beans to the thick stew, then the soup, then the watery broth, which was to sustain them throughout the war. (p. 33)\nIt seems Tigris has been selflessly ensuring the Snows\u0026rsquo; survival from an extremely young age. Although she was forced into the role by the war and the Grandma\u0026rsquo;am\u0026rsquo;s incompetence, we are given no indication that she is dissatisfied with her lot.\nCollecting taxes from Sejanus Plinth in his palatial apartment on the Corso while he lived in some rat hole fifty blocks out? (p. 36)\nCoriolanus is prone to catastrophizing. The minute he hears a rumor that might threaten his family\u0026rsquo;s tenuous finances, he imagines himself living in a hovel and collecting taxes from the Plinths in an apartment much like his own once was. This explicit inversion of the Capitol-District relationship that threatens the foundation of Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s worldview is entirely imagined, a product of his own paranoia and penchant for overthinking.\nThe cousins agreed that he needed to make a good first impression on the girl so that she would be willing to work with him. He should treat her not as a condemned prisoner, but as a guest\u0026hellip; It would give him a jump on the assignment, as well as an opportunity to win her trust. \u0026ldquo;Imagine how terrified she must be, Coryo,\u0026rdquo; Tigris had said. \u0026ldquo;How alone she must feel. If it was me, anything you could do to make me feel like you cared about me would go a long way\u0026hellip; Like I was of value.\u0026rdquo; (pp. 37-38).\nThe direct quote from Tigris demonstrates her empathy. She does view Tigris as a human with human emotions, not as a condemned prisoner or subhuman District scum. Coriolanus, on the other hand, views treating Lucy Gray well as a means to an end. He seeks to gain her trust so that he can leverage it to bolster his grade. His trip to the train station is motivated not by a desire to make Lucy Gray feel safe and wanted, but to get a head start over his peers.\nAnother girl, a typical girl, would be impressed, but there was nothing typical about Lucy Gray Baird. In fact there was something intimidating about a girl who\u0026hellip; had dropped a venomous snake down another girl\u0026rsquo;s dress. Of course, he didn\u0026rsquo;t know that it was venomous, but that was where the mind went, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it? She was terrifying, really. And here he was\u0026hellip; hoping she would — what? Like him? Trust him? Not kill him on sight? (p. 39)\nCoriolanus makes some outrageous assumptions here. He firstly assumes that the snake Lucy Gray dropped down Mayfair\u0026rsquo;s dress was poisonous, and justifies this assumption by presenting it as the logical conclusion that anybody would drop. We have no evidence that this is the case. It seems rather to be a manifestation of his intense paranoia. He fears her without any real reason to, going so far as to suspect that she might murder him in cold blood.\nIt is interesting to note his fearful reaction to the snake, despite his characterization in the Trilogy as being snake-like himself. He has yet to adopt poison as his modus operandi, nor has he yet consciously accepted his tendency toward deception.\nThey really were creatures out of another world. A hopeless, brutish world. (p. 41)\nAnother example of Coriolanus thinking of the tributes as subhuman. They are, to his mind, inherently animalistic.\n\u0026ldquo;Besides,\u0026rdquo; she said, \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rsquo;s my mentor. Supposed to help me. I might need him.\u0026rdquo; (p. 46)\nSince we lack access to Lucy Gray\u0026rsquo;s actual thoughts in this moment, we can only speculate. If we take her at her word, it seems that Lucy Gray is taking advantage of Coriolanus in the same way that he is taking advantage of her. They are compatriots in this respect, perhaps laying the groundwork for their budding relationship. It is also possible that this is merely an excuse to save his life, something that she thinks the other tributes will accept. At the very least, we know that Lucy Gray is not helpless. She is able to adapt to Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s role as her mentor and is ready to make use of this unexpected resource.\nWithout turning he knew it was the girl, his girl\u0026hellip; (p. 49)\nHis girl. Lucy Gray is his property.\nLucy Gray raised her hand to meet his but refrained from sticking it through the bars, which might have appeared threatening. (p. 51)\nLucy Gray is keenly aware of her surroundings and how she appears to those around her. She knows how to take control of appearances, and acts in just the right way to diffuse the fear of her Capitol audience.\nCoriolanus could sense the audience beginning to warm up to his tribute, no longer bothering to keep their distance. People were easy to manipulate when it came to their children. (p. 52)\nLucy Gray is a performer by trade. It is entirely possible that her situational awareness and social skills are simply the result of professional experience. Coriolanus, however, assumes that this is an intentional manipulation, betraying his own manipulative tendencies.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re good at games. Maybe one day you\u0026rsquo;ll be a Gamemaker.\u0026rdquo; (p. 59)\n\u0026ldquo;Game recognize game,\u0026rdquo; as the saying goes. Dr. Gaul immediately sees in Coriolanus a kindred soul: he is quick on his feet, takes initiative, and is a natural manipulator. He passes her test, and she makes the decision to take him under her wing right away.\n\u0026ldquo;It is if no one watches!\u0026rdquo; she snapped back. She gave Coriolanus an indulgent smile. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s a child himself. Give him time. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a good feeling about this one\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; (p. 60)\nDr. Gaul explicitly acknowledges her recognition of Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s potential before excusing herself. Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s thoughts about the Hunger Games, the role they play, and the nature of humanity are implicitly laid out for his future education.\nWhat was Sejanus up to? Was he trying to outdo him and steal the day\u0026rsquo;s thunder? To take his idea of coming to the zoo and then dress it up in a way Coriolanus could never compete with, because he could never afford to? (p. 63)\nCoriolanus cannot conceive in a world in which Sejanus feeds the Tributes purely out of altruism, empathy, or compassion. He must assume that Sejanus is trying to compete with him. We see again his insecurities about Sejanus\u0026rsquo;s wealth and status.\nHe wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure. The optics so far were good, singling her out again, presenting her as someone of value. But to eat with her? That might cross a line. (p. 65)\nCoriolanus here implies Lucy Gray\u0026rsquo;s subhuman status. She is an object. An object of value, to be sure, and it is especially valuable to him if others see her as valuable as well. But to eat with her as though she were a fellow human, a fellow citizen of Panem? That surely crosses a line.\nCoriolanus didn\u0026rsquo;t like sharing the spotlight, but Sejanus\u0026rsquo;s presence could protect him\u0026hellip; he would\u0026rsquo;ve thought the name Snow carried more weight than Plinth, but\u0026hellip; he\u0026rsquo;d prefer to have Sejanus by his side. (pp. 66-67)\nA begrudging friendship based on expedience is born. It is interesting to note Coriolanus\u0026rsquo;s lackluster and ignorant response to the episode between Sejanus and Marcus. Coriolanus is keenly aware that Sejanus is from District Two, but he fails to see any reason for the strain between the two. To Coriolanus, it is as if Sejanus\u0026rsquo;s life began when he moved to the Capitol. Anything before then is part of a dark, primordial past.\nHere, in the relative privacy of the corner, he realized for the first time that she would be dead in a few days\u0026hellip; he had thought about her more as his contender. His filly in a race, his dog in a fight. The more he treated her as something special, the more she\u0026rsquo;d become human\u0026hellip; Lucy Gray was not really an animal, even if she was not Capitol. (p. 68)\nCoriolanus invokes the images of horse racing and dog fighting. He explicitly acknowledges his thinking of her as subhuman, and his treatment of her as an animal. She had value only insofar as it allowed Coriolanus to sell tickets to the show, so to speak. And yet, he has begun to recognize something human in her. Coriolanus attributes this to his own actions — it is his treatment of her that elevates her. However, we have seen his appreciation of her talents, the personality traits they share, and their subsequently growing camaraderie. It is becoming increasingly difficult not to recognize Lucy Gray\u0026rsquo;s humanity. We will see whether this changes once she is no longer behind bars.\nKatniss Conclusion Trauma and dialectics The world is but a perpetual see-saw\u0026hellip; I do not portray his being; I portray his passage; not a passage from one age to another\u0026hellip; but from day to day, from minute to minute. I must suit my story to the hour, for soon I may change, not only by chance but also by intention. It is a record of various and variable occurrences, an account of thoughts that are unsettled and, as chance will have it, at times contradictory, either because I am then another self, or because I approach my subject under different circumstances and with other considerations. (Keightley \u0026amp; Pickering, 2014, p. 15)\n[Trauma] is a condition of individual psychic damage of such severity that the person who suffers from it is unable to make experience storyable and knowable. (Keightley \u0026amp; Pickering, 2014, p. 168)\nIt is because remembered experience is constitutive of our successive selves as these inform our sense of identity through time that the distinguishing feature of traumatic experience is its denial or severe inhibition of [a resynthesis of the traumatic memory]. (Keightley \u0026amp; Pickering, 2014, p. 170)\nHow do I put this basically enough? It\u0026rsquo;s a philosophical theory, the kind you might encounter if you took time to read some books. The fundamental premise is to envision history as a sequence of \u0026ldquo;dialectical\u0026rdquo; conflicts. Each dialectic begins with a proposition, a thesis, which inherently contains, or creates, its opposite - an antithesis. Thesis and antithesis. The conflict is inevitable.\nBut the resolution of the conflict yields something new - a synthesis - eliminating the flaws in each, leaving behind common elements and ideas. (Obsidian Entertainment, 2010)\nA post-apocalyptic Prometheus Prometheus has been reinvented and reinterpreted time and again since his entrance into the (extant) literary canon in the 8th century BCE. For our purposes, it is sufficient to say that Prometheus is a titan who defies the will of the gods by bringing Fire to humanity.\nPrometheus\u0026rsquo;s identity as a titan is significant. The titans are older and more powerful than the gods, but were overthrown by them. Prometheus is the last remnant of a fallen race and lives now in a social and cosmic order defined and determined by the gods. Prometheus is powerful enough to defy the will of the gods, but not powerful enough to escape punishment. The consequence of his rebellion is to have his liver eaten daily by birds, only to have it regrow to be eaten again ad infinitum.\nCoriolanus Snow, too, is the last of a once-great, now-fallen dynasty. The Snows were once among the most powerful of Capitol\u0026rsquo;s family, but they have been brought low and replaced by a new order of Plinths.\nBut while Prometheus\u0026rsquo;s Fire was knowledge, technology, philosophy, and society, stolen from the gods and given to lowly humans, those are not things wanted nor needed by the \u0026ldquo;lowly\u0026rdquo; Districts. Snow\u0026rsquo;s Fire is compassion, kindness, love, and empathy. Snow\u0026rsquo;s Fire is that indwelling spirit of human goodness which the Districts possess and the Capitol lacks. Prometheus is moved by pity to give Fire to humanity. Snow is unable to be moved by anything but disdain.\nWhen Snow sees the Fire of humanness in Sejanus, he snuffs it out. When he cannot control the Fire of freedom in Lucy Gray, he stifles it. Prometheus is blinded by the temptation of the Fire; Snow is blinded by the status quo, so invested in conforming to the power structure of the gods\u0026rsquo; world to even recognize the Fire\u0026rsquo;s value.\nPrometheus is a hero, and he suffers the tragic fate of a hero. Snow is no such thing. He is the Capitol\u0026rsquo;s faithful servant and lives a long life.\nReferences Collins, S. (2009). The Hunger Games. Scholastic.\nCollins, S. (2011). Mockingjay.

He believed that Jesus was created ex nihilo, from nothing, the same way that the rest of Creation was. While he may have believed Jesus was the Son of God, and was divine himself, he was not himself God, or made up of the same substance as God.\nArius and his followers became known as Arians, and they would spark a centuries-long conflict in the early Christian Church.\nUnfortunately for Arius, Alexandria was also home to a deacon by the name of Athanasius. Athanasius would dedicate his life to stamping out the Arian Heresy.\nAthanasius was a strong believer in the consubstantiality of God and Christ. He argued that God and Jesus were not only made up of the same stuff, but were co-eternal and co-equal. Jesus was not created, but existed alongside and as a part of God from the very beginning.\nThe battle between Arius and Athanasius came to a head at the Council of Nicea in 325 CE, where Athanasius would succeed in persuading Church leadership to his view. Arius and his followers were successfully branded heretics. Still, popular support for Arianism was strong, and its supporters included Emperor Constantine the Great. It would take several more decades for the early Church to fully stamp out the Arian Heresy.\nThe Council of Nicea was not only important for what it condemned, but for what it proclaimed. Out of the Council emerged two important cornerstones of world Christendom: the elevation of the books of John and Revelation, and the writing of the Nicene Creed.\nContrary to popular belief, the Council of Nicea was not responsible for the canonization of the Christian Bible. The Roman Catholic Church would not declare an official canon until fifty years later at the Council of Rome in 382 CE, and most of the books adopted were already widely accepted and circulated throughout the early Church.\nIn 140 CE, Marcion of Sinope drew up a list of texts which he considered canonical. Marcion\u0026rsquo;s list included a good deal of the present-day New Testament canon, including Luke, Galatians, I and II Corinthians, Romans, I and II Thessalonians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon, and Philippians.\nIn roughly 180 CE, Irenaeus advocated for the four-gospel canon and drew on all of the books in the present-day New Testament except Philemon, II Peter, III John, and Jude in his treatise Against Heresies.\nBy 200 CE, Origen of Alexandria was (probably) using the same list of 27 books that we have today.\nCanonization took place gradually over centuries, and was influenced by what early Christians were actually reading and circulating. It was not imposed on the Church by its leaders, but was formulated from the bottom up before being officially accepted.\nThe Council of Nicea did, however, put to rest much of the early Church\u0026rsquo;s discomfort with the books of John and Revelation. The Gospel of John is the only Gospel not to follow the Synoptic formula and expresses many ideas which seem to align with gnosticism, another heresy the early Church worked hard to destroy. Revelation is a bizarre revenge fantasy about Jesus returning to lead his people in violent revolt against Rome, disguised as apocalypse literature (a genre of literature in which readers \u0026ldquo;in the know\u0026rdquo; were expected to unpack dense metaphors to uncover the true meaning of the text).\nThey hardly seem to fit in with the rest of the New Testament canon, but Athanasius fought to defend them and to elevate them to stand on equal footing with the other books. They were perfect weapons against Arianism.\nThe Gospel of John begins, \u0026ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\u0026hellip; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\u0026rdquo; Clearly Jesus was not created, but is co-eternal and co-equal with God! Likewise, the Book of Revelation is filled to the brim with colorful illustrations of Christ\u0026rsquo;s divine nature and authority.\nSo the Church leadership at the Council of Nicea reached consensus regarding the Arian Heresy and had Scripture to support their stance. For the sake of the unity of the Church, and to combat the spread of Arianism and other heretical ideas, they formulated the Nicene Creed.\nWe believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible.\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father [the only-begotten; that is, of the essence of the Father, God of God,] Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;\nBy whom all things were made [both in heaven and on earth];\nWho for us men, and for our salvation, came down and was incarnate and was made man;\nHe suffered, and the third day he rose again, ascended into heaven;\nFrom thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.\nAnd in the Holy Ghost.\n[But those who say: 'There was a time when he was not;' and 'He was not before he was made;' and 'He was made out of nothing,' or 'He is of another substance' or 'essence,' or 'The Son of God is created,' or 'changeable,' or 'alterable'\u0026mdash; they are condemned by the holy catholic and apostolic Church.]\nThus was Christian orthodoxy born. Or, at least, codified.\nOrthodoxy and orthopraxy Orthodoxy, Greek for \u0026ldquo;correct belief\u0026rdquo;, has been baked into the fabric of the Western worldview for millennia. Most aspects of an individual\u0026rsquo;s identity are defined by belief. A Christian believes in the divinity, death, and resurrection of Christ. An atheist believes that there is no God and that science and reason are the key to living a fulfilling moral life. A Democrat believes in using the power of government to aid and uplift marginalized groups. Republicans believe in individuals\u0026rsquo; freedom to do as they please with their hard-earned resources without government interference. Some trans people believe that their gender is determined by their internal alignment with socially defined gender roles. Some gay people believe that their same-sex attraction is an intrinsic part of their identity as much as is their height, shoe size, or love of pizza (I am assuming, correctly, that loving pizza is a universal constant).\nOften, I am asked what Jews believe. Sometimes the question is asked by somebody who knows little about Judaism and is hoping to get a general sense for what Judaism is all about. Sometimes the question is more specific: \u0026ldquo;What do Jews believe about such and such?\u0026rdquo; Regardless, my answer is always the same, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Which Jews, and when, and where?\u0026rdquo;\nUnlike so many Western religions, Judaism is not orthodoxic. Judaism is orthopraxic; it emphasizes correct action over correct belief. That makes talking about Jewish beliefs a little tricky.\nIn general, Jews believe in one God. We say the shema, a prayer declaring the Oneness of God, multiple times a day. However, not all Jews believe in God. Many Jews lost their faith in God in the face of the Holocaust, and they are still Jewish. Some humanistic and secular Jews may not believe in God, and they are still Jewish. Some Jews are pantheists, believing that God is not a distinct entity but that all things are God, and they are still Jewish. I can generally count on a Chabadnik to have some tefillin I can borrow, but I can\u0026rsquo;t as easily predict his thoughts, feelings, or beliefs beyond \u0026ldquo;Yes, you should wrap tefillin.\u0026rdquo;\nThere have been some attempts to capture in writing the spirit of Jewish beliefs. The famous medieval rabbi Maimonides wrote one such list of 13 Principles of Faith. However, we are pretty sure his list was an attempt to explain Judaism to non-Jews in the hopes that they would ease up a little on the Jewish community. It is not widely known or accepted by the majority of world Jewry, and is of extremely limited actual usefulness.\nJudaism as a religion is, instead, focused on observing the mitzvot, acts of religious observance commanded by God in the Torah. Some mitzvot are positive: you should give charity, or you should pray the shema before you go to sleep. Some mitzvot are negative: you should not work on the Sabbath, or you should not eat pork. There aren\u0026rsquo;t any mitzvot telling Jews what they should or should not believe in, only what they should or should not do.\nA non-Jew said to Rabbi Hillel, \u0026ldquo;I will convert to Judaism if you can teach me the whole of the Torah while I stand on one foot.\u0026rdquo;\nRabbi Hillel replied, \u0026ldquo;What is hateful to you, do not do to another. That is the whole of the Torah. The rest is commentary. Go and study.\u0026rdquo;\nRabbi Akiva added, \u0026ldquo;Love the other as you love yourself.\u0026rdquo;\nThe most repeated commandment in the Hebrew Bible is to be kind to the strangers, for you were strangers in Egypt and you know how it feels to be oppressed.\nOf course, not all Jews observe the mitzvot, or observe the mitzvot to various degrees. Plenty of Jews eat bacon or go to work on Friday, and they are still Jews. A child born to Jewish parents and raised in a Jewish household who chooses not to believe in God or to observe a single mitzvot is still a Jew.\nAnd if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, what even is a Jew? Perhaps what makes a Jew is their genetic heritage\u0026mdash;but converts can become Jews regardless of their genetic makeup. Maybe a Jew is simply somebody who observes a set of cultural practices, like eating matzo and lox\u0026mdash;but matzo and lox are Ashkenazic customs, and Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews have their own, distinct sets of customs. The definition of a Jew gets muddier and muddier as you go!\nEthno-religions Here we come up against another limit of the Western worldview: the separation of the concepts of ethnicity, culture, and religion. Judaism is an ethno-religious group. Judaism is not merely an ethnic group, set of cultural practices, or religion. It is all three at once, with all three aspects being inextricable parts of the whole.\nAll Jews are descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (or descendants of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Judah, which is about as far back as we can historically verify). Many are genetic descendants. Many married into the family. Some were adopted into the family through conversion. Although world Jewry has been broken up and scattered across the world, developing into a number of distinct Diaspora cultures, we are all still family. The food we eat might have different flavors or colors, but we observe the kashrut laws. We pray the same prayers in the same ancestral tongue. We observe the same Shabbat, read the same Torah, and argue in the same Talmudic idiom. As many differences as there are between different Jewish communities, there are more similarities. In this way, Judaism can be thought of as an ethnic group whose cultural heritage includes a common religious practice. In other words, Judaism is an ethno-religion.\nNo wonder it\u0026rsquo;s so much harder to convert to Judaism than many other religions! In order to become a Christian, one need only accept Jesus as the Christ and profess their faith. In order to convert to Islam, one need only profess their belief in Allah and the Prophet Muhammad. There are religious and cultural practices that one might be expected to adopt after conversion, but they are not crucial to religious identity.\nConverting to Judaism, however, requires a period of study supervised by a Rabbi, and the approval of a Rabbinical Court (beit din). The beit din might ask about your beliefs, but they will ask much more about your understanding of Jewish history, ritual, culture, practice, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s less like converting to a religion, and more like seeking citizenship in a new country.\nOf course, Jewish identity has become increasingly more complicated since the establishment of the political State of Israel in 1948. A detailed discussion of Zionism and Israel is beyond the scope of the present essay. Various strands of Zionist thought have sought to replace Jewish religious identity with a secular, nationalist one, a strategy which the Israeli government has largely adopted. The Israeli government has also, in various ways, attempted to exercise control over Jewish religious life. Likewise, some religious sects have exerted disproportionate influence on Israeli policy. Discussion about Israel\u0026rsquo;s role in Jewish life and identity has been ubiquitous, and sometimes heated, since the October 7th Hamas attack and Israel\u0026rsquo;s military response; and, although the historical and political situation in the Levant is incredibly complicated, a sharp increase in global antisemitism and violent attacks against Diaspora Jews, has made taking a stance on Israel a matter of public safety for Diaspora communities.\nJewish identity, like all identities, is complicated. It is especially so when approached from a Western, predominantly Christian worldview. We live in an age when social media amplifies the most alarmist and vitriolic opinions and extremist populist movements are sweeping across the United States and Europe. I hope that this essay will serve to foster some understanding between Americans and the Jews among them.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/orthopraxy/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"nicea-canonization-and-the-aryan-heresy\"\u003eNicea, canonization, and the Aryan Heresy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the 4th Century CE, in bustling Alexandria, Egypt, a presbyter name Arius argued that Jesus Christ was a \u0026ldquo;god from nothing\u0026rdquo;.
