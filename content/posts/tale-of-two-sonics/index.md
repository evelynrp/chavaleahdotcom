When I saw the first Sonic movie, it was out of morbid curiosity. Surely there was no way the studio could have salvaged what was sure to be a trainwreck, another cash-grab live action film preying on nostalgia with no meaningful substance to speak of.

Boy, was I wrong.

The first movie wasn't perfect. It had a few too many dated jokes and Fortnite dances. It was a little generic. But it wasn't remotely *bad*. It was, in fact, a somewhat touching tale about a blue alien finding a family in a faraway land, and learning to stop running (lol) and stand up to protect what was important to him. Classic shonen manga stuff.

Sonic 2 built on this and reached new heights. While still not perfect, with some minor pacing issues, it reached new levels of emotional resonance and cinematic fight scene special effects glory.

Sonic 3 was a string of bad, loosely-connected jokes and fanservice bone-throws.
