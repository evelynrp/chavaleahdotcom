For most of the history of the West, this question would make little sense. Religion and ethnicity, or at least some intrinsic element of identity like "peoplehood", have typically been inseparable. Christian history offers a striking example. Before 1517 CE, nearly all of Europe was Catholic. After Luther kicked off the Protestant Reformation, a good chunk of Europe became Protestant. But the shift from Catholicism to Protestantism did not occur on an individual basis. Germany is an excellent example, since medieval Germany was not a unified nation state but rather a hodgepodge of duchies, baronies, and petty kingdoms. It was the Duke or Baron who decided whether to convert, and all of his subjects followed, regardless of personal inclination. To not do so was to risk losing peoplehood, to become an enemy to one's own community, and to face discrimination, persecution, and, possibly, criminal charges.

Even today, we retain subconscious biases which link religion and ethnicity together. Many white Americans, when they see a Middle-Eastern looking man behind the counter at a gas station, assume he must be Muslim.

It wasn't until after Napoleon's conquest that the ideas of the Enlightenment, including the right to self-determination regarding religion, became widespread in the West. Coincidentally, this is also when Jews first were granted citizenship in European nation-states. Until then, Jews were excluded from peoplehood, whether that peoplehood was French, Italian, Spanish, German, etc. They were segregated into ghettos; their employment opportunities were restricted to those professions which were unsuitable for good Christians; they had few to no rights and maintained their own courts, law enforcement, and marketplaces. To convert to Christianity meant to abandon family, tradition, community, and whatever sense of self was bound up in the teachings and ideals of Judaism. This is why so few did, even at the point of a sword.

Today, boundaries are more permeable. The privileges of citizenship mean that a Jew can pursue any profession, marry anyone, live anywhere. Identity as a Jew is no longer so strictly enforced as it once was, and many Jews identify as secular and have little involvement in Jewish life, or convert to Christianity or Buddhism.

So, in our contemporary world, what does make somebody Jewish?
