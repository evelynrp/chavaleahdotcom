1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,540
Okay, so, Gary asked the first question, what is a Gentile? A Gentile is just a non-Jew.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:21,840
So this is Judaism for not Jews. This is class number one. Was it Gary who asked me this morning about, I'm not trying to convert you?

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:32,080
Right. It's just part of your religion to come out in the public and try to educate people.

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:43,880
We don't convert people. We do not do proselytization. The only reason I'm doing this is because around Easter time,

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:52,100
we did that Passover potluck, and people seemed to have some interest in the concept of a Seder and, like, what do Jews do around this time?

6
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,300
And then people brought bread and macaroni and pizza to the Passover potluck, and Passover is the festival of unleavened bread,

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:14,940
and Jews are not allowed to eat bread or pasta or pizza. So I thought that was a little bit, um, almost like a faux pas, kind of, you know?

8
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:21,840
But, of course, y'all didn't know what Passover was or anything, so that's why I'm doing this class.

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,640
If anyone has questions about anything at any point, stop me and ask them.

10
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,780
These are some of the questions that I'm hoping to answer today.

11
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,620
So isn't Judaism just Christianity without Jesus? What's the difference? Like, isn't the only real difference that Jews reject Christ?

12
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:50,560
Isn't it just Christianity with more rules? Like, what you can and can't do? Like, eat bread during Passover.

13
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,860
And what's the deal with the Jews crucifying our Lord and Savior?

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Right, so to answer the Jesus questions, we should probably start with addressing whether or not Jesus was a real history guy,

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,220
or just made up, I guess.

16
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,880
Um, so this is a quote from the book, New Testament History and Literature.

17
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,680
The New Testament contains contradictory historical accounts of various parts of early Christianity.

18
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,340
The account of the birth of Jesus and the origins of his family provided by Matthew

19
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,340
is totally different from that in Luke,

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,260
and any harmonization cannot stand up to the standards of modern historiography.

21
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,260
The different narratives of his resurrection appearances,

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,840
who of his disciples claimed they had seen him, when and where,

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,240
and Mark, Matthew, Luke, and Paul all contradict one another.

24
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,780
The New Testament is simply not a reliable source for the history of Jesus or early Christianity

25
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,660
when taken at face value.

26
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,820
This is a pretty common thing for ancient historical sources.

27
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,100
They weren't interested in hard facts the same way that we are.

28
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,900
They were more interested in presenting an interpretation of history in order to convey the right message.

29
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,800
So if a kid asks you, what's electricity?

30
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,320
How does electricity work?

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,900
You might answer them, um, well, you know, there's, there's power in the walls,

32
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,320
and the power goes through wires, and it makes machines work,

33
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,480
because kids aren't going to understand electricity is the flow of electrons,

34
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,340
and, uh, electrons flow from a higher to a lower voltage in order to reach equilibrium,

35
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,100
and all that nonsense, and probably most of us don't really understand how electricity works either.

36
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,740
So we present an interpretation of the facts in order to get a message across,

37
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,740
and that is probably what the gospel authors were doing.

38
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,920
And that's why there are some contradictions between accounts.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,360
Well, isn't it also because it was probably oral history and so forth?

40
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,140
I mean, my brother and sister and I can get together and talk about something that happened 40 years ago.

41
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,400
That too, it does.

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,700
It doesn't mean a different memory.

43
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
So it could be partly.

44
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,940
Yeah, the Bible is probably part of it.

45
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,140
It's not univocal.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
It's told by many voices.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,520
And so there's always going to be some differences in how people remember things,

48
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,420
how people choose to tell a story.

49
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,180
But yeah, that does make it a little bit more difficult to nail down the historicity of the gospel accounts.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,800
Okay, so what archaeological evidence do we have for the existence of Jesus as a historical figure?

51
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,480
This is the first pretty much not-gospel evidence that we have for Jesus.

52
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,940
It's called the Alex Aminos graffiti, and scholars date it to around 200 CE.

53
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,540
I am sure that you cannot make out any of this.

54
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,940
So, here's a sketch instead.

55
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:59,080
We have a horse-headed man hanging on the cross with the inscription,

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,260
Alex Aminos worships his God.

57
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:11,780
This is a sort of derogatory graffiti making fun of this Christian for worshiping a God

58
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,180
who was executed in a brutal and humiliating way.

59
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,920
So, where was it found?

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,700
Somewhere in the Roman Empire, but I believe the city of Rome itself.

61
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,280
It's interesting that that's a Roman cross.

62
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,140
It's not the cross that we have.

63
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,360
It's a T-shaped cross.

64
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,580
Yep.

65
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,000
Yep.

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,540
So, we know for sure that by 200 CE, there were some people going around worshiping a God

67
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,560
who had been executed on a cross.

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,220
They didn't give us a name or anything for this God, unfortunately,

69
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,460
but we can be pretty sure that it's Jesus.

70
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:04,660
We also have some non-Christian literary sources from the Jews in the Talmud.

71
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,140
What is the Talmud?

72
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,140
Who knows?

73
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,760
What's the Talmud?

74
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,840
You don't know.

75
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,580
We're all in trouble.

76
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,080
Is it an idol?

77
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,700
Right?

78
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,900
Not really.

79
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,540
Is it a group of people?

80
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,340
Are there the writings?

81
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,020
Is the Talmud the writings?

82
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,740
You have the prophets.

83
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:30,380
Okay, so you're getting at something sort of different.

84
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,080
So, the Hebrew scriptures or the Old Testament is divided into three sections.

85
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,240
The law, the prophets, and the writings.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,960
The law or the Torah is the first five books.

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,340
The five books of Moses or the Pentateuch.

88
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:55,000
Then you have the prophets, the Nevi'im, we call them in Hebrew.

89
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,400
And that's Isaiah and all those guys.

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,400
And we have the writings, the Ketuvim.

91
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,520
That's everything else.

92
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:12,580
So, the Psalms, Song of Songs, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, all that stuff.

93
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,440
But that's all in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament.

94
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,320
Which we call the Tanakh, which is an acronym.

95
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,220
Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim.

96
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:32,480
After the Tanakh was sort of formalized, Jews kept on saying things and writing things.

97
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,700
And we collected that into a volume called the Mishnah.

98
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,620
And then they kept on saying things and commenting on the Mishnah.

99
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,980
So, we compiled that into the Gemara, which is the commentary on the Mishnah.

100
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,380
And the Mishnah and the Gemara together are called the Talmud.

101
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:57,020
So, this was probably written down sometime after the Jews were kicked out of Israel the last time.

102
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,800
So, before Moses separated the Red Sea?

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,820
Long, long after.

104
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:04,600
Okay.

105
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,400
Moses was, if he existed, probably a couple thousand years BCE.

106
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,500
And this probably would have been around, I don't know, 200 or so CE.

107
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,400
Around the same time that the New Testament Gospels were being written down, we were writing down the Talmud.

108
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,540
And so, that's just everybody's conversations and commentary on everybody else's conversations.

109
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,720
It's commentaries on commentaries on commentaries.

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,980
So, that's why the saying, like, you know, nine Jewish rabbis in a room, ten opinions.

111
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,160
Yeah, two Jews, three opinions.

112
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,740
There's actually a funny story.

113
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:54,220
The Old Testament translation that Jesus had was called the Septuagint.

114
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,940
It was a translation of the Hebrew into Aramaic, which was kind of the lingua franca of the time.

115
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,980
All the Greeks, the Greek Jews spoke Aramaic.

116
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,280
And it was considered at the time to be a miracle.

117
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,580
Because the Greek authorities got, like, 70 rabbis in a room together.

118
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,960
No, they got, they put 70 rabbis in 70 different rooms.

119
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,660
And they weren't allowed to communicate.

120
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,800
And they all came up with the same Aramaic translation.

121
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,960
But the Jews said, if you want a real miracle, put them all in the same room.

122
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:39,160
So, this is a story from the Talmud that might be talking about Jesus of Nazareth.

123
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,820
And it goes like, so.

124
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:49,880
So, on Passover Eve, they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning.

125
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,760
And a crier went out before him for 40 days, publicly proclaiming,

126
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,740
Jesus the Nazarene is going to be stoned because he practiced sorcery,

127
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,080
incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray.

128
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,260
Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf.

129
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,640
And the court did not find a reason to acquit him.

130
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,820
And so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover Eve.

131
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,500
Ola said, how can you understand this proof?

132
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,420
Was Jesus the Nazarene worthy of conducting a search for a reason to acquit him?

133
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,940
He was an insider to idol worship.

134
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,300
And the merciful one states with regard to an insider to idol worship,

135
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,760
neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him.

136
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,860
Rather, Jesus was different as he had close ties with the government

137
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,020
and the Gentile authorities were interested in his acquittal.

138
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,840
So, consequently, the court gave him every opportunity to clear himself

139
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,700
so that it could not be claimed that he was falsely convicted.

140
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,460
What the heck is going on here?

141
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,700
So this story is really about, um, stay,

142
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,780
about due process in Jewish law.

143
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,560
There is this guy called Jesus the Nazarene,

144
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,420
and the Jews are going to execute him for practicing sorcery

145
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,760
and inciting the Jews to idol worship.

146
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,880
And it describes a sort of due process

147
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
that the Jews give to Jesus the Nazarene

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
where they have a guy go out and say,

149
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,300
hey, this guy is on trial.

150
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,300
He's about to be executed.

151
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,780
Anyone who has evidence to help him

152
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,760
should definitely come forward before he dies.

153
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,040
And this rabbi, Ulla, is saying,

154
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,760
why did we do this?

155
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,240
Insiders to idol worship are not supposed to get any sort of due process.

156
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,500
We're supposed to just kill them according to our law.

157
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
So what's the deal?

158
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,900
And the answer is,

159
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,600
Jesus was very close to the Gentile authorities,

160
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,560
the Roman government.

161
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,220
So if we just killed him,

162
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,120
that would look bad for us,

163
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,820
and we might get in trouble with the Romans.

164
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,680
So that's why we had a crier go out ahead of time.

165
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,820
This does not sound like the gospel accounts of the crucifixion.

166
00:11:59,460 --> 00:11:59,800
No.

167
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,900
I mean, the Jews hang him on Passover Eve.

168
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,080
That doesn't make any sense

169
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,940
because Jesus was crucified after Passover.

170
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,540
Jesus was not that close to the Gentile authorities,

171
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:11,820
considering...

172
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,820
They didn't like him.

173
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,980
They kneeled him to a cross, etc., etc.

174
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,160
So, what do we do with this?

175
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,620
Is this evidence of Jesus or not?

176
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,300
We don't know.

177
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,660
Here's another Talmudic story about someone named Jesus.

178
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,480
What is the word on top?

179
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,100
This is the book of the Talmud that it comes from,

180
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,940
and this is the page that it's on.

181
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,300
So, it's kind of like Matthew 7, 9, something like that.

182
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,760
Was Sanhedrin a person?

183
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,320
The Sanhedrin is the Jewish court,

184
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,900
so this is the volume of the Talmud

185
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,520
that deals with the discussions upon discussions

186
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,180
about the Jewish court,

187
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,960
and most of it has nothing to do with the Sanhedrin, actually.

188
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,660
But that's a story for another time.

189
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,980
Yehoshua ben Prechaia said,

190
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,620
How beautiful is this inn?

191
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,900
Jesus, his students, said to him,

192
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,880
But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper's wife are narrow.

193
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,720
Yehoshua said to him,

194
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,940
Look in one!

195
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,280
Do not involve yourself with regard to that manner,

196
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,960
the appearance of a married woman.

197
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,660
So he produced 400 shoferot and ostracized him.

198
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,100
So these guys, Yehoshua and his student Jesus,

199
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,620
go to an inn.

200
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,500
Yehoshua says, This inn is awesome.

201
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,380
And Jesus says,

202
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,140
Yeah, and the innkeeper's wife is kind of a looker, right?

203
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,680
That's what eyes are narrow means?

204
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,340
Yeah, she looks like a bit of a loose woman.

205
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm like, my eyes are narrow.

206
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,240
So Yehoshua says,

207
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,580
What are you doing commenting on the appearance of a married woman?

208
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,340
Get out of here, you're ostracized.

209
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,160
We shun you.

210
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,220
What's 400 shofar?

211
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,200
A shofar is the horn that we blow at certain ritual occasions.

212
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:29,120
So he gets 400 people who blow shofar to officially ostracize him from the Jewish community.

213
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,400
And everybody knows it because we had 400 shofar out.

214
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,940
So he's kicked out.

215
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,180
He's pretty much kicked out for this.

216
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
Excluded from the community.

217
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,840
So maybe we should just say that Jesus is a very common name.

218
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,520
That is true.

219
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,480
This could be anybody's guess who this person is.

220
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,660
Jesus came before Yehoshua several times and said to him,

221
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,340
Accept my repentance.

222
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,920
Yehoshua took no notice of him.

223
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,540
One day Yehoshua was reciting the Shema, the central prayer in Judaism, one of them.

224
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,080
And Jesus came before him with the same request.

225
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,020
Yehoshua intended to accept his request and signaled him with his hand to wait until he completed his prayer.

226
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,320
It's against Jewish law to interrupt the Shema.

227
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,480
Because it's very important.

228
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,680
So Jesus approaches him while he's reciting and he says,

229
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,440
Hold on a second.

230
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,480
But Jesus didn't understand the signal and thought,

231
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,820
He's driving me away.

232
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,920
So he went and stood a brick upright to serve as an idol and bowed down to it.

233
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,960
Yehoshua then said to Jesus,

234
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,620
Repent!

235
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,020
And Jesus said to him,

236
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,320
This is the tradition that I received from you.

237
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,540
Whoever sins and causes the masses to sin is not given the opportunity to repent.

238
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,900
And the master says,

239
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,080
Jesus performed sorcery inside of the Jews to engage in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,460
Jews today use this story as an example of how not to treat people.

241
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,780
Often we will say that this was Jesus, Jesus.

242
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,300
Even if the facts don't quite line up.

243
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:21,500
And we'll say that Jesus went off and started his own religion because one of our rabbis was a jerk and wouldn't take his repentance.

244
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,580
And that's what Jesus says here when he says,

245
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,840
Yehoshua says repent, and Jesus says,

246
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,960
Look, I learned from you that even if I try to repent, you're not going to accept it.

247
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,200
So why should I even bother with you anymore?

248
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,760
You're a jerk.

249
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,860
But is this the Jesus of the New Testament?

250
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,880
I don't know.

251
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,420
So, Evelyn, in this prayer that you just said,

252
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,200
they say, Lord.

253
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,120
Who is the Lord that they're talking about?

254
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,660
The word there in the Hebrew is the Tetragrammaton,

255
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,540
Yad-Heh-Vav-Heh.

256
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,740
This is the name that God gave to Moses at the burning bush to identify himself.

257
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:15,580
But we don't say that name, so we use a substitution, Adonai, and that's generally translated as Lord.

258
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:25,460
So, in the Jewish religion, we believe in God, but not Jesus, as our Savior.

259
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,320
That's pretty much what we're trying to answer.

260
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,120
We don't accept him as the Messiah,

261
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,920
but we're also not really sure if he was even a real historical guy

262
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,580
or if the Gospel accounts happened as they're written or, you know.

263
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,340
And why do we not accept Jesus?

264
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,860
What do we really think about him?

265
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,700
Well, to answer that, I will pose to you a question.

266
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,060
Who do you prefer, Rabbi Hillel or Rabbi Shammai?

267
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,620
Don't know the dude.

268
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,800
Yeah, you don't know the dude.

269
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,900
We don't really think about Jesus that much, honestly.

270
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,220
I think there's a sort of misconception that Jews just really are against Jesus,

271
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,620
but kind of just don't care.

272
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,220
I personally think that Jesus, as he's presented in the Gospels,

273
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,660
was a brilliant, radical reformer,

274
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,820
and that the Jews could probably listen to him here and there.

275
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,080
But the whole, like, Messiah, Son of God thing,

276
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,760
it's a little bit odd.

277
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,820
So Jews don't believe in the Holy Trinity.

278
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,880
Where does the Holy Spirit come in here?

279
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,080
The Holy Spirit.

280
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:58,840
I mean, everybody has the breath of God within them.

281
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,780
Are you going to, at some point,

282
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,980
because I don't want to get in the way of your narrative,

283
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,420
but are you going to talk about some of the differences,

284
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,980
like the differences in terms of belief in an eternal life,

285
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,660
or that sort of thing?

286
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,760
Was I going to?

287
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,780
Maybe, maybe not.

288
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,620
Write it down, add it to your list.

289
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,860
So it's Hillel and Shammai.

290
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,200
You don't know who they are?

291
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,180
Why do you care?

292
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,600
Yeah.

293
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,740
Hillel founded a society.

294
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,640
The Hillel Society.

295
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,760
I don't think he founded that.

296
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,440
He did invent the sandwich, allegedly.

297
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:44,040
I do want to address this question, though.

298
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,280
Differences in belief like the afterlife and such.

299
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,260
Afterlife is a tricky question,

300
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,260
because it's not directly addressed in the Tanakh,

301
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,300
the Hebrew scriptures.

302
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,260
So in the Tanakh,

303
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,540
the closest that we get to is a place called Sheol.

304
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,720
Translates to grave,

305
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,680
described as a dark, watery place underground.

306
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,600
So according to the Tanakh,

307
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,260
when you die, you get buried.

308
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,620
And that's about as far as we get.

309
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,080
After the Tanakh,

310
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,360
we have come up with various different theories.

311
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,800
One of them is the idea of the world to come.

312
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,640
This is pretty analogous to what Jesus would have called

313
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
the kingdom of God.

314
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,860
Some sort of utopian future

315
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,240
in which things will not suck.

316
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,940
And maybe some of us will come back to life.

317
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,120
Maybe some of us won't.

318
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,360
Some people believed in the resurrection.

319
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,300
Some didn't.

320
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,180
The Apostle Paul actually manages to escape

321
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,560
from persecution once

322
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,600
by bringing up bodily resurrection.

323
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,620
And then all the Jews start arguing with each other

324
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,680
and he kind of just slips away.

325
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,380
Some Jews today believe in reincarnation.

326
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,680
There's no real agreement.

327
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,540
Who were these people?

328
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,200
Hillel and Shammai were two very popular rabbis

329
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,080
back in the day.

330
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,520
What did it?

331
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,140
I don't know.

332
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,820
Nobody knows the mythical time of

333
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,220
when we tell stories about the sages.

334
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,960
No one knows.

335
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,820
But they, yes?

336
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,460
The question is,

337
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,540
the Gospels were written like,

338
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,240
say, a hundred years or so

339
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,640
after the death of Jesus.

340
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,280
Yes.

341
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,820
Now, when was this written and stuff?

342
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,400
I mean, is everything just open to interpretations

343
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,780
from who's ever writing whatever, you know?

344
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,440
The Talmud was probably written

345
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,480
about the same time as the Gospels.

346
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,740
So everything takes place

347
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,640
hundreds of years after the fact.

348
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,740
So it's just whatever the people,

349
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:01,920
you know,

350
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,880
oh, well, so-and-so said this or that.

351
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,700
And they don't actually know.

352
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,060
I mean.

353
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,400
Whatever message that they're trying to get across

354
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,920
is what they write down.

355
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,840
They didn't have cell phones to them.

356
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,900
And the internet.

357
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,380
And most people were not very literate,

358
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,760
so they couldn't have written things down.

359
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,180
Right.

360
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,420
We think that Paul was illiterate

361
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,920
and dictated all his letters.

362
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,460
Actually, I think we know that for sure

363
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,460
because he says in the preamble to the letters,

364
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm Paul,

365
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,200
and this was written down by so-and-so.

366
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,140
But yeah, Hillel and Shammai

367
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,660
had two competing schools of thought,

368
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,000
and Hillel won pretty much every single argument.

369
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,200
And we only remember Shammai as a loser.

370
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,140
We've accepted that we can't know for sure

371
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,280
if Jesus was real or not.

372
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,440
Plenty of people are willing to just say,

373
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,460
yeah, he probably did.

374
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,800
What was Jesus's relationship with Jews?

375
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,580
So to understand that,

376
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,600
we're going to go through

377
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,360
what did Judaism look like in Jesus's day?

378
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
So Jesus was around during the second temple.

379
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,640
The first temple was destroyed

380
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
many long time ago.

381
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,660
And then the Jews came back to Israel

382
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,400
after some time away,

383
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,460
built a second temple.

384
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,780
And that's where Jesus is going all the time

385
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,500
whenever he goes to Jerusalem.

386
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,060
We have three main factions,

387
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,220
the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Zealots.

388
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,520
You might recognize some of these guys

389
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,020
from many of the Jesus stories.

390
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,060
So the Sadducees are the priestly class.

391
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,240
They run the temple.

392
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,420
They're in charge of the temple sacrifices.

393
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:44,860
They got into power because of a revolt earlier

394
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,720
when they kicked the Greeks out of the temple.

395
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,480
So they kind of have some political status.

396
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,240
And they work together with the Romans

397
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,720
because they have political status.

398
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,400
They want the Romans to not take that away from them.

399
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,660
They're very interested in maintaining the status quo.

400
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,300
The Pharisees are a faction that came out of the exile

401
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,980
in between the first and second temple.

402
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,740
So Judaism was pretty centered around the temple

403
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,520
until the exile when the temple was destroyed.

404
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,400
And they couldn't really do temple stuff anymore.

405
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
So they had to figure out,

406
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,100
how do we stay Jews in exile?

407
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,140
So they invented this form of portable Judaism

408
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,160
that was less focused on the temple rituals

409
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,760
and more focused on the Torah,

410
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,280
obeying the commands, personal piety.

411
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,400
This resulted in a decentralization of practice.

412
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,020
We didn't have to necessarily rely on the temple.

413
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,820
And they are a separatist faction

414
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,200
because they're so focused on the law,

415
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,120
they sort of isolate themselves.

416
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,360
They don't hang out with non-Pharisees very much.

417
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,700
They definitely will not eat at the same table as a Gentile

418
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,180
because who knows what Gentiles are eating.

419
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,420
It might not be kosher.

420
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,440
They might be praying to idols at that table, et cetera.

421
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,180
And then the Zealots are the anti-Roman guerrilla fighters.

422
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,880
They lived up in the Judean hill country

423
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,060
and would just get together and go attack some Romans.

424
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,920
Every now and then.

425
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,620
When would this have been?

426
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,660
This would have been around the time of Jesus,

427
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,320
probably around, I think we're talking 20 CE.

428
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,140
The second temple was destroyed in the year 70.

429
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,540
So around 0 to 70-ish CE.

430
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,720
Was there a connection between the Zealots and Masada?

431
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,020
Who?

432
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,420
Masada, the fortification that the Romans took.

433
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,680
I haven't read my Josephus enough, so I'm not...

434
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,020
When you talk about the second temple,

435
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,700
were those described as big temples in Jerusalem?

436
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,420
Is this one like the...

437
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,280
Yes.

438
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,280
Like the golden one?

439
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,120
So the first temple that I refer to is the Temple of Solomon.

440
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,220
It's the central location of Jewish worship

441
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,320
from the time of Solomon

442
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,300
throughout the whole Old Testament, basically.

443
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,060
Solomon is described to have built an enormous temple

444
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,220
with a lot of gold and a lot of stuff.

445
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,760
And then the Babylonians come in and knock that down.

446
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,640
And a while later, the Persians say,

447
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,840
you're allowed to go back and build a new one.

448
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,860
It's not quite as impressive as the first one.

449
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,860
And the people who remember the first one

450
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,660
start crying because it's so lame

451
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,900
compared to what they remember.

452
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:55,460
And then the Romans knocked that one down,

453
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,840
and now there's no temple.

454
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:57,940
Okay.

455
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,220
So it's the one temple.

456
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,440
Yes.

457
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,860
One temple.

458
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,360
Okay.

459
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,980
Unless you're a Samaritan

460
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,100
because they had a different temple,

461
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,820
but that's a whole other conversation.

462
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,860
Any other questions?

463
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,780
So this is way before they did the Golden Dome?

464
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:19,720
Temple?

465
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,500
Yeah, that's a Muslim temple.

466
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,960
The Al-Waksim Mosque.

467
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,440
Yeah.

468
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,380
My bad.

469
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,580
What was Jesus' relationship to all these guys?

470
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,360
We can probably guess that the Pharisees and Sadducees

471
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,700
weren't too fond of him if you've read your Gospels

472
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,940
because they're always trying to trick him

473
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,400
into saying silly things.

474
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,120
So let's start with some stories.

475
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,620
Then they came to Jerusalem,

476
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,980
and he, Jesus, entered the temple

477
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,180
and began to drive out those who were selling

478
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,980
and those who were buying in the temple,

479
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,620
and he overturned the tables of the money changers

480
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,340
and the seats of those who sold doves,

481
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,880
and he would not allow anyone

482
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,400
to carry anything through the temple.

483
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,100
He was teaching and saying,

484
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,040
Is it not written,

485
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,740
My house shall be called a house of prayer

486
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,880
for all the nations?

487
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,620
But you have made it a den of robbers.

488
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,940
And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it,

489
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,180
they kept looking for a way to kill him,

490
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,720
for they were afraid of him,

491
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,820
because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching.

492
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,600
It makes sense.

493
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,880
It does make sense.

494
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,460
We're probably talking about the Sadducees here

495
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
because it's the temple,

496
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,620
and the Sadducees control the temple cult.

497
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,300
And they are being,

498
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,740
Judy mentioned them earlier today,

499
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,160
saying that they're charging for money conversion.

500
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,780
They're charging for the sacrifices that you have to make.

501
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,080
They're not optional.

502
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,040
They are mandatory.

503
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,540
Everyone's skimming off the top.

504
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,000
And Jesus is not okay with the Sadducees

505
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,240
profiting off of mandatory religious ritual.

506
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,380
So he thinks that everyone should be able to participate

507
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,360
in temple sacrifice,

508
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,380
whether they can afford to or not.

509
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,440
So he comes in and says,

510
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,600
You guys are a bunch of jerks.

511
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,540
I'm flipping your tables.

512
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,260
So there's clearly bad blood between Jesus and the Sadducees.

513
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,940
Next we have Jesus and the Pharisees.

514
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,240
And as Jesus sat at dinner in the house,

515
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,380
many tax collectors and sinners came

516
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,200
and were sitting with Jesus and his disciples.

517
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,200
When the Pharisees saw this,

518
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,680
he said to his disciples,

519
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,880
Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?

520
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,180
But when he heard this, he said,

521
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,200
Those who are well have no need of a physician,

522
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,480
but those who are sick.

523
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,620
Go and learn what this means.

524
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,220
I desire mercy, not sacrifice.

525
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,500
For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.

526
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,280
So we talked earlier about how Pharisees won't eat with non-Pharisees

527
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,380
because they're worried about becoming ritually impure

528
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,320
or accidentally eating non-kosher food,

529
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,160
food that might have been sacrificed to idols.

530
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,440
So they see Jesus eating with these people,

531
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,820
tax collectors and sinners.

532
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,980
I always think it's funny that tax collectors are lumped in.

533
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,860
The historical reason for that is that tax collectors worked with and for the Romans,

534
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,420
and they usually would not take Jewish law very seriously.

535
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,020
They were pretty assimilated to Roman culture.

536
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,440
They were considered, like, traitors.

537
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,360
Okay, so the Pharisees are very focused on the law,

538
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,740
the book of the law.

539
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,760
But Jesus here is quoting from the prophets, like Isaiah,

540
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,840
in which God says,

541
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,340
Your sacrifices are meaningless to me.

542
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,660
Your festivals are repugnant.

543
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,860
The sacrifice that I want is for you to take care of the poor,

544
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,720
the widow, and the orphan.

545
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,500
Jesus took this message to heart and preached it quite regularly.

546
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,700
And so he's kind of calling the Pharisees out for being very hoity-toity,

547
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,960
but not actually doing anything useful that is actually helping anybody.

548
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,740
We've got quite a few of them people in our society now,

549
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,900
and Jesus needs to come and talk to them again.

550
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,380
That's an understatement.

551
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,760
Yeah.

552
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:34,120
And we have a story that deals a little bit with his relationship with the zealots.

553
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,500
Then they, meaning the authorities, the Jewish authorities,

554
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,680
sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said.

555
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,120
And they came and said to him,

556
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,480
Teacher, we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one,

557
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,840
for you do not regard people with partiality,

558
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,840
but teach the way of God in accordance with truth.

559
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,600
Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?

560
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,360
Should we pay them or should we not?

561
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,800
But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them,

562
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,960
Why are you putting me to the test?

563
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,440
Bring me a denarius and let me see it.

564
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,680
And they brought one.

565
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,860
And he said to them,

566
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,160
Whose head is this and whose title?

567
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,160
They answered, Caesar's.

568
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,540
Jesus said to them,

569
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:23,160
Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.

570
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,960
They were utterly amazed at him.

571
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,040
So they're trying to catch him in a trap where if he says,

572
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,920
Yes, we should pay our taxes, then he's a Roman shill.

573
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,100
And if he says, No, we should not pay our taxes,

574
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,640
then they can get him in trouble with the Roman government.

575
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,740
So either way, he's between a rock and a hard place.

576
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,540
But he pulls this maneuver where he says,

577
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Look, it's George Washington's face on the quarter.

578
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,620
God doesn't care about this.

579
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,100
The money is already his.

580
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,140
Just give it back to him.

581
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:05,920
So he's clearly rejecting the sort of militaristic, anti-Roman position of the Zealots.

582
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,920
What are the Herodians?

583
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,240
Herodians, they're the faction of King Herod,

584
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,360
who was put into power after the Maccabean Revolt,

585
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,060
which was the same revolt that put the Sadducees in power.

586
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,540
So he's pretty much referring to the Sadducees in a roundabout way.

587
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,260
So people higher up.

588
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,100
Yes.

589
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,040
So Jesus had strong words for everybody.

590
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,380
He was very radical,

591
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,220
very interested in reforming the Jewish community into something better.

592
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,540
Are the Jews responsible for killing Jesus?

593
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:55,140
This has been a thing that Jews have had to deal with for the last 2,000 years,

594
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,920
being called the Christ killers.

595
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,480
According to this book,

596
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,260
Jesus was executed by a crucifixion,

597
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,300
which was a common method of torture and execution used by the Romans.

598
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,340
So the execution of Jesus was a Roman affair,

599
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,600
possibly with the cooperation of Jewish leadership in Jerusalem.

600
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,860
The Romans did not need to try a troublesome Jewish peasant in order to kill him.

601
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:26,760
They tortured and crucified nameless lower class people all the time in order to get rid of Jesus,

602
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,240
who had caused a disturbance in the temple,

603
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,760
had made radical sounding pronouncements and prophecies,

604
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,280
and was rumored to have aspirations to kingship.

605
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,100
The Romans would have simply taken him by force and crucified him the next day,

606
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,500
along with a few others they were getting rid of.

607
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,200
There was no need for any trial,

608
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,840
much less two or more before different courts

609
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,980
would have been more trouble than a Roman government needed for the desired result.

610
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:54,380
So the gospel narratives are a little bit confusing

611
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,580
in the context of the actual political reality of the time.

612
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:03,200
It seems like all the rigmarole was completely unnecessary.

613
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,100
But I like to take literature seriously anyways.

614
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,500
So if we read the gospel accounts and what they say,

615
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,280
we can just say that they happen pretty much

616
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
the way that they're written down

617
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,000
and still get some information out of them.

618
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,840
There's a few threads common to all of the gospel accounts.

619
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,820
Some differences, but there are some commonalities.

620
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,500
First one is that in all of the accounts,

621
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:44,400
Jesus is captured by the Romans in collaboration with the Sadducees

622
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,840
because he is a threat to their power

623
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,260
and the institutions, political institutions that they're a part of.

624
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,640
He is directly flipping over their tables and such

625
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,220
and calling for reform, trying to take away their sources of revenue.

626
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,380
Does anyone know who Barabbas is?

627
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,380
It was the alternative.

628
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,640
Yes.

629
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,000
Yes.

630
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:13,680
Yes.

631
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,020
In the gospel accounts, when Jesus is brought before Pilate,

632
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,080
the governor of Judea,

633
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:26,640
apparently there is a tradition around Passover

634
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,220
when the governor would pardon one criminal,

635
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,300
whoever the Jews chose.

636
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,240
This is an outrageous tradition.

637
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,340
There's no way this happened.

638
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,460
It's kind of like Prima Nocta and Braveheart,

639
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,240
if you've seen that.

640
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,280
It's very good storytelling,

641
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,840
but it probably didn't happen.

642
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,380
So there's Jesus and there's Barabbas,

643
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,180
who is the other criminal.

644
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,740
He's described as a murderer and a seditionist.

645
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,820
And the Jews say,

646
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,940
we want Barabbas.

647
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,240
Free that guy.

648
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,400
Barabbas is not a real name.

649
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,660
It's Aramaic.

650
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,200
Bar-Abbas, son of the father,

651
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,780
which is completely meaningless.

652
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It basically just means a person.

653
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,020
We can contrast that with the name that Jesus used for himself,

654
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,900
son of man,

655
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,780
which is completely meaningless

656
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,480
and basically just means a person.

657
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,300
So the gospel narratives are creating this dichotomy

658
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,420
between Jesus and Barabbas,

659
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,180
who are their names are meant to be similar,

660
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,300
to call our attention to them.

661
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,540
Jesus is this peace-loving pacifist.

662
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,240
He is submitting himself to execution.

663
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,900
The gospel of John says,

664
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,960
I could free myself if I wanted.

665
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,480
I could have my followers storm this place and free me,

666
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,900
but I'm not going to do that

667
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:59,360
because my kingdom is a kingdom of peace.

668
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,360
It's a kingdom of the last coming first,

669
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,640
the mighty being brought low.

670
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,020
Meanwhile, Barabbas is an insurrectionist and a murderer.

671
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,100
He's one of the zealots probably

672
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,180
going around trying to gain Jewish independence

673
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,840
from Rome by violent means.

674
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,060
So the story is saying the Jews chose violence

675
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:27,160
rather than the way of peace that Jesus was teaching.

676
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,260
And I think that's probably the message

677
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,640
that the Jews of the first century would have heard.

678
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,760
So, yeah.

679
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,780
We also know that Jesus was a victim

680
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,840
of sort of a mob mentality

681
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,520
in all of the gospel accounts.

682
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,420
It's the Sadducees who start up

683
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,140
the crucified Jesus chants

684
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,160
and everybody kind of just goes along.

685
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,920
I don't know if anyone here

686
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,320
has seen the movie Borat.

687
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,300
But if you have,

688
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,060
you've seen Sacha Baron Cohen

689
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,320
pretending to be a foreigner

690
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,140
going up and saying things like,

691
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,160
we support your war of terror.

692
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,460
We support killing every single man,

693
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,460
woman, and child in Iraq.

694
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,760
And all the people start cheering

695
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,840
and going along with it.

696
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,760
So it's pretty easy to get a mob

697
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,860
to agree with almost anything.

698
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,580
And again,

699
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,940
Roman execution,

700
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,780
the historicity of whether or not

701
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
the Jews were allowed

702
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,060
to administer capital punishment

703
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,220
is in question.

704
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,260
But according to the gospel narratives,

705
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,820
they couldn't,

706
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,160
and that's why they had to bring him

707
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,700
to the Romans.

708
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,060
But pretty clearly,

709
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,640
okay,

710
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,280
so how is Judaism different from Christianity?

711
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,360
Jews are more focused on action than belief.

712
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:58,220
nobody cares really

713
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,860
if a Jew believes in God or not.

714
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
There are a ton of atheist Jews

715
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,580
who are still Jewish

716
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,500
and still very accepted as Jews.

717
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,600
What we care about is

718
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,760
being a good person,

719
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,380
obeying the laws maybe.

720
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,580
Depending on what that means to you,

721
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,520
there are a lot of different positions.

722
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,380
I think for Christians,

723
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,800
mostly there is a lot more

724
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,880
emphasis on belief.

725
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,740
You are expected to believe in Jesus,

726
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,320
believe in the resurrection.

727
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,840
There's a bunch of creeds

728
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,760
like the Apostles' Creed,

729
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,560
the Nicene Creed.

730
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,660
You might know of those.

731
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,020
Many, many Christians

732
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,060
were burned at the stake

733
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,200
by Christian authorities

734
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,360
for having

735
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,120
some heretical beliefs.

736
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,500
Judy would have been

737
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,240
burned at the stake

738
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,540
if she was a believer.

739
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,980
I wouldn't have laughed so long.

740
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,180
That's great.

741
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,460
Christianity is generally considered

742
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,020
to be a pretty individual affair.

743
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,280
It's between you and Jesus.

744
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,740
Judaism is a group activity.

745
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,040
You cannot be Jewish by yourself.

746
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,120
Say what?

747
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,800
You cannot be Jewish by yourself.

748
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,820
It's cultural.

749
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,520
Jews cannot pray alone

750
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,420
most of the prayers.

751
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,480
There's so many people alone.

752
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,180
You're required to pray in dominion,

753
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,780
which is often translated as a quorum,

754
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,200
which is traditionally a group

755
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,220
of ten adult Jewish men.

756
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,060
Today, we will usually let women

757
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,080
be part of the dominion.

758
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,280
Thanks.

759
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,260
You're not allowed to do

760
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,740
morning practices by yourself.

761
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,000
If your mom or dad dies,

762
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,300
you have to pray the morning prayers

763
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,140
in a dominion.

764
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,100
You're not allowed to practice that

765
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,260
in isolation.

766
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,260
So, you have to go to the temple?

767
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:02,660
Yes.

768
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,100
Yeah.

769
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,580
Currently.

770
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,780
Currently.

771
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,540
We don't have a temple temple anymore.

772
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,900
So, you'd have to find

773
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,360
like your local synagogue,

774
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,980
which sometimes we will call a temple.

775
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,400
A better translation would be

776
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,980
a house of prayer.

777
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,440
So, yeah.

778
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,220
You can pray at homes

779
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,000
or does it have to be at the synagogue?

780
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,960
It can be anywhere

781
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
as long as you have a minion.

782
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,880
Of mostly men.

783
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,320
Depends on how orthodox you are.

784
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,900
Well, that's my question.

785
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,880
So, when you say more focused

786
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,040
on action than belief,

787
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,580
what would an orthodox rabbi say?

788
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,300
Think of that bullet point.

789
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,360
Would they agree with you?

790
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,840
An orthodox is stricter?

791
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Just so I know what you're...

792
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,040
I just want to clarify.

793
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,500
Versus reform.

794
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,800
Right.

795
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,820
There's three major branches of Judaism

796
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,040
today in America.

797
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,400
We have the modern orthodox,

798
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,060
the conservative,

799
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,980
and the reform.

800
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,240
I won't get too much into the history,

801
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,040
but they all have

802
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,640
different positions

803
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,800
about the Jewish law,

804
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,240
and that's the key differentiation.

805
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,760
So, is Jewish law binding?

806
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,740
Are we required

807
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,940
to follow Jewish law?

808
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,040
And, can Jewish law

809
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,800
change over time?

810
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,000
Are we allowed

811
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,140
to reinterpret

812
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,540
the law

813
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,320
in response

814
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,340
to our changing times?

815
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,360
So, the modern orthodox

816
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,220
basically say,

817
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,740
yes, Jewish law is binding,

818
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,840
and no, it does not change.

819
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,220
So, they are very

820
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,100
conservative,

821
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,180
very much sticks in the mud.

822
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,820
The conservative movement

823
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,940
is kind of a middle ground.

824
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,620
Yes, the law is binding.

825
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,760
You have to follow the law,

826
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,660
but we can change it

827
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,740
in response to

828
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,960
our evolving understanding

829
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,620
of humanity

830
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,220
and society.

831
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,640
Reform

832
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,680
are

833
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,160
very loosey-goosey.

834
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,080
The law is not binding.

835
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,420
It's more of a suggestion,

836
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,780
and it's subject to change.

837
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,900
We can adapt it.

838
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:13,120
So, the modern orthodox

839
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,980
would still agree

840
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,280
that action is much more

841
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,180
important than belief.

842
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,180
But they might think

843
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,460
that a lot of the,

844
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,440
for example,

845
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,180
atheist Jews

846
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,900
are crazy.

847
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,140
So, that would be

848
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,500
under the last cow.

849
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:33,880
The crazies?

850
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,980
The crazy people.

851
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,180
You're just saying

852
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,580
reform.

853
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:37,760
Yeah.

854
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,940
They'd probably be

855
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,040
considered more reform,

856
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,020
but I, yeah.

857
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,680
Yes?

858
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,540
Well, I'm focusing

859
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,400
on the word action.

860
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,960
So, when you say

861
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,760
an orthodox

862
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,100
would still believe

863
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,580
that action

864
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,380
is more important

865
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:49,760
than belief,

866
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,100
what's,

867
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,540
is that action like,

868
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,200
like following

869
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,900
the rituals?

870
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,600
rituals?

871
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,420
Yeah.

872
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,240
For the orthodox,

873
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,680
it would primarily be

874
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,500
doing the three daily prayers,

875
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,220
keeping kosher,

876
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,420
making sure

877
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,060
that you

878
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,680
don't touch

879
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,440
dead bodies

880
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,120
or lizards

881
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,100
or whatever.

882
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,340
But not on good works.

883
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,980
Not so much

884
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,860
for the orthodox,

885
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,400
but the further

886
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:19,840
you get

887
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,400
to the right

888
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,100
of this chart,

889
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,860
the less

890
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,900
that they're worried

891
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,860
about the sort

892
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,500
of traditional

893
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,280
laws

894
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,800
and the more

895
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,400
that they're worried

896
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,380
about the more

897
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,360
social justice

898
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,120
part of it,

899
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,340
the prophetic,

900
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,160
I don't care

901
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,120
about your fasts,

902
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:35,860
help the poor.

903
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,360
Clothing,

904
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,020
clothing

905
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,600
and hair.

906
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:41,720
Yeah,

907
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,780
that's more on this side,

908
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,600
the clothing requirements.

909
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,960
This just is reminding me

910
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,160
of Christianity today

911
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,880
with the extreme

912
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,820
conservative fundamentalists

913
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,000
who would have

914
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,240
stormed out of here

915
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,900
when you said

916
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,760
anything at all

917
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,340
about whether

918
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,380
Jesus existed

919
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,160
or not

920
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,900
because the Bible

921
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,600
is inerrant,

922
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,320
infallible

923
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,000
and has no

924
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,020
contradictions in it.

925
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,260
I mean,

926
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,300
that's their position

927
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,040
and so the law

928
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,640
is everything

929
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,060
and your belief

930
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,500
is everything.

931
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,400
But on the other side,

932
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:11,800
it would be like

933
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,160
the UCC for sure

934
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,360
and the Presbyterians

935
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,620
to a degree

936
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,060
that we're going

937
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,160
to put social justice

938
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,640
and human needs first.

939
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,520
So would you say

940
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,880
we're more reform?

941
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:23,480
Sure.

942
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,600
As Christians,

943
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,320
oh yeah,

944
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,140
because the folks

945
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,060
on the left,

946
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,740
on this chart that is,

947
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,980
don't even think

948
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,040
that progressive Christians

949
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,080
are Christians at all.

950
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,320
They think we're going to hell

951
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,160
because we don't believe

952
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,100
the way they believe.

953
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,480
They're very rigid

954
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,840
and that's who's

955
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,760
in power right now.

956
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,160
That mindset

957
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,140
is the powerful mindset

958
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,340
in our country.

959
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,040
In fact,

960
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,920
the modern orthodox

961
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,260
wouldn't even consider me Jewish

962
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,900
because I had

963
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,240
conservative conversion

964
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,980
and that is not

965
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,960
strict enough for them.

966
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:52,400
Bless you.

967
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,080
So are there different

968
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:54,920
synagogues

969
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,900
with these different,

970
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,340
you can be a

971
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,500
conservative

972
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
synagogue

973
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,200
or you can be a reform.

974
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,760
For the most part,

975
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,240
a Jew is a Jew

976
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,540
and you can go

977
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,920
to wherever you want.

978
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,820
This is

979
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:14,020
more at

980
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,880
like an institutional level

981
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,660
of,

982
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,500
you know,

983
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,280
there's like a bunch

984
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:20,840
of rabbis

985
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,740
in a building somewhere

986
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,180
making rules

987
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,160
and publishing books

988
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,680
and stuff

989
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,660
but most everyday Jews

990
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,740
just don't really care

991
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,220
that much

992
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:28,840
and will go to

993
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,560
whatever synagogue

994
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,300
is closest.

995
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,280
So if you

996
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,220
walk

997
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,780
to synagogue,

998
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,880
does that mean

999
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,040
you're at least

1000
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,700
a conservative?

1001
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,640
Would the reformed Jews

1002
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,560
consider that

1003
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,320
this idea

1004
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,600
of not doing

1005
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,420
work,

1006
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,660
not starting

1007
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,400
your car,

1008
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,720
would they go

1009
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,100
for that

1010
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:51,540
or is that

1011
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,440
a conservative Jew?

1012
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,360
The car issue

1013
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,900
is not really

1014
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,600
a work issue.

1015
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,140
It's about

1016
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:00,960
kindling fire

1017
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,460
on the Sabbath

1018
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,520
or carrying

1019
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,120
on the Sabbath

1020
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,160
which are two

1021
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,320
other prohibitions

1022
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,340
that you're not

1023
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:07,740
allowed to do

1024
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,120
those things

1025
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,580
on the Sabbath.

1026
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,020
Modern Orthodox,

1027
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:12,940
you definitely

1028
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,560
are not allowed

1029
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,180
to drive a car.

1030
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,760
The leaders

1031
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,460
of the conservative

1032
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:17,940
movement

1033
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,020
made a ruling

1034
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,000
some years ago

1035
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,920
that

1036
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,280
it's better

1037
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,760
for you

1038
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,380
to go

1039
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,020
to synagogue

1040
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,040
than not.

1041
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,200
So if you

1042
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,120
must drive

1043
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:28,940
to get to

1044
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,200
synagogue

1045
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,180
then you can

1046
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,960
but you probably

1047
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,380
shouldn't be

1048
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,240
driving anywhere else.

1049
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,360
That kind of

1050
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:34,720
sounds like

1051
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,720
an Amish people.

1052
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,160
So with not

1053
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,040
using the power,

1054
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,980
the energy

1055
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,620
that is only

1056
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,080
on Sabbath.

1057
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,860
Electric cars

1058
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,780
are fine.

1059
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:46,920
Really?

1060
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,100
Because

1061
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,460
it's kindling

1062
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,460
fire that

1063
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,020
is prohibited.

1064
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,720
So the spark

1065
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,100
flag

1066
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,000
or the...

1067
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,200
Yeah,

1068
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,480
internal combustion

1069
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,120
engines are all...

1070
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,920
But without using

1071
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,000
lights in the house,

1072
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,280
isn't that considered

1073
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,560
by the Orthodox...

1074
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,240
Modern Orthodox,

1075
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,100
for some reason,

1076
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,140
have decided

1077
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:07,980
that electricity

1078
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,640
is fire.

1079
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:09,960
Yes.

1080
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,180
Nobody else

1081
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:11,540
agrees.

1082
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:12,280
Okay.

1083
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,080
Weird.

1084
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:14,780
Yeah.

1085
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:15,620
Yeah.

1086
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
So you can go back

1087
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,800
to what you were saying.

1088
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:20,700
I don't know

1089
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,300
what I was saying.

1090
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,020
What was I saying?

1091
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:25,800
Alright,

1092
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,600
so traditionally

1093
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,160
Judaism is transmitted

1094
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,000
by the mother.

1095
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,040
So if your mom

1096
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,540
is Jewish

1097
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,000
then you're

1098
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,060
automatically Jewish.

1099
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,720
Different positions

1100
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,400
on this now.

1101
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,060
Most people

1102
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:36,640
will say that

1103
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,260
if either of your

1104
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,620
parents was Jewish

1105
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,120
and you were

1106
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,720
exposed to Judaism

1107
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,500
growing up

1108
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,580
then you count.

1109
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,360
Converting to...

1110
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:46,640
Yes.

1111
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,800
Can I ask a question?

1112
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,280
Yes.

1113
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:49,540
Okay,

1114
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,760
so my grandfather

1115
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,820
was Jewish

1116
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,960
and my grandmother

1117
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,880
wasn't.

1118
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,420
Mm-hmm.

1119
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,480
Does that affect

1120
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,000
my grandfather's

1121
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,680
Judaism

1122
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,420
or...

1123
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,440
Is the question

1124
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,100
does marrying

1125
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,600
a non-Jew

1126
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,480
make him less Jewish?

1127
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,540
Does he...

1128
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,140
He stays Jewish,

1129
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,520
right?

1130
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,060
Yes.

1131
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,580
Okay.

1132
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,580
You know,

1133
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,200
you can't stop

1134
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,740
being Jewish.

1135
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,160
Okay.

1136
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,120
You couldn't

1137
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,860
convert to another

1138
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,240
religion?

1139
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:18,960
I could,

1140
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,500
but I wouldn't

1141
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,320
stop being a Jew.

1142
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,660
I would just be

1143
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,000
an apostate.

1144
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,220
A non-Jew

1145
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,420
not a person

1146
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,020
or an apostate?

1147
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,040
Is that a Christian

1148
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,960
or Christian Jews

1149
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,980
or some Christian Jews?

1150
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,180
Yeah,

1151
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:32,740
there are.

1152
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,260
Yeah.

1153
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:33,820
Yeah.

1154
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,280
There are a lot

1155
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,060
of Buddhist Jews.

1156
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,220
A whole lot

1157
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,020
of Buddhist Jews.

1158
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,380
We call them

1159
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,900
Jubus.

1160
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:42,780
Oh!

1161
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:42,940
Oh!

1162
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,280
But don't repeat

1163
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:47,580
that.

1164
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,080
That's our word.

1165
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,680
So,

1166
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,420
converting to Judaism

1167
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,360
is quite different

1168
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,180
than Christianity.

1169
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,220
Especially,

1170
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,220
for some reason,

1171
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:00,520
like,

1172
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,660
the more conservative

1173
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,220
Christian,

1174
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,200
the easier it is

1175
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,520
to become Christian.

1176
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:04,860
like,

1177
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,480
you just pray

1178
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,860
the prayer,

1179
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:07,300
like,

1180
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,040
I accept Jesus

1181
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,720
into my heart

1182
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,060
and boom,

1183
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,640
you're Christian.

1184
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,000
For Judaism,

1185
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,540
if anybody remembers

1186
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,040
the,

1187
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:16,920
what is it called,

1188
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:17,960
confirmation classes,

1189
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,220
that kind of stuff,

1190
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,300
it's sort of like that.

1191
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,460
We generally have to spend

1192
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,580
at least a year

1193
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,760
studying Judaism,

1194
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,760
learning all the

1195
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,500
laws and the

1196
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,020
traditions

1197
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,780
and the practices

1198
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,760
and the customs

1199
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,080
and the history.

1200
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,380
So it's more like

1201
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,460
trying to get

1202
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,000
citizenship

1203
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,280
in a new country

1204
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,480
where you have to

1205
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,180
live in the country

1206
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,780
for a while

1207
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,340
and then you have

1208
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,140
to take an exam.

1209
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,600
When I converted,

1210
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,420
I had to sit

1211
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,160
in front of a

1212
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,420
Jewish court

1213
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,660
of three rabbis

1214
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,240
and they asked me

1215
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,740
questions

1216
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,540
and I had to

1217
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,000
prove that I knew

1218
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,040
what I was talking about

1219
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,240
and I'm sincere.

1220
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,680
before I was alive.

1221
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:57,280
Yeah.

1222
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,900
Oh, there was a lot

1223
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,300
of pressure.

1224
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,560
I dabbed like an idiot.

1225
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,460
Without being a smart

1226
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,960
aleck, right?

1227
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,840
I was still a smart aleck.

1228
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,240
Do you read Hebrew?

1229
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,520
Is that a requirement?

1230
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,040
Reading Hebrew

1231
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,620
is a requirement

1232
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,500
for the modern Orthodox.

1233
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,000
I cannot read Hebrew.

1234
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,460
I can sort of

1235
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,080
sound things out

1236
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,540
a little bit

1237
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,360
but a lot of the letters

1238
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:21,900
look the same

1239
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,380
and the vowels

1240
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,000
are really hard

1241
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,580
to figure out.

1242
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,240
But that's the end

1243
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,820
of my slides.

1244
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:26,800
Okay, there.

1245
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,480
That was perfect.

1246
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,060
That's very nice.

1247
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:29,760
Very good.

1248
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,940
Thank you.

1249
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,280
Yeah.

1250
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,200
That was interesting.

1251
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,420
I missed a lot of it.

1252
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,040
Thank you.

1253
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,440
Yay.

1254
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Thank you.

1255
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,000
Thank you.

1256
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,600
Next time,

1257
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,640
I think I will

1258
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,740
focus more

1259
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,460
on some of the

1260
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,120
common Jewish practices

1261
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,960
like what is

1262
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,900
Jewish prayer like?

1263
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,120
What's the deal

1264
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,100
with the funny hats

1265
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,600
and the clothes

1266
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,080
and stuff?

1267
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:52,720
Oh, yeah.

1268
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,880
That kind of thing.

1269
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,100
Mm-hmm.

1270
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,040
That kind of thing.

1271
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,360
So...

1272
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:26,340
Thank you.
