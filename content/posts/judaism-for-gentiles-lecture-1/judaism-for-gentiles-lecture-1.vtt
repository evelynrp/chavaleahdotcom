00:00.000 --> 00:10.540
Okay, so, Gary asked the first question, what is a Gentile? A Gentile is just a non-Jew.

00:10.540 --> 00:21.840
So this is Judaism for not Jews. This is class number one. Was it Gary who asked me this morning about, I'm not trying to convert you?

00:21.840 --> 00:32.080
Right. It's just part of your religion to come out in the public and try to educate people.

00:32.080 --> 00:43.880
We don't convert people. We do not do proselytization. The only reason I'm doing this is because around Easter time,

00:43.880 --> 00:52.100
we did that Passover potluck, and people seemed to have some interest in the concept of a Seder and, like, what do Jews do around this time?

00:52.100 --> 01:02.300
And then people brought bread and macaroni and pizza to the Passover potluck, and Passover is the festival of unleavened bread,

01:02.440 --> 01:14.940
and Jews are not allowed to eat bread or pasta or pizza. So I thought that was a little bit, um, almost like a faux pas, kind of, you know?

01:14.940 --> 01:21.840
But, of course, y'all didn't know what Passover was or anything, so that's why I'm doing this class.

01:22.640 --> 01:28.640
If anyone has questions about anything at any point, stop me and ask them.

01:29.180 --> 01:32.780
These are some of the questions that I'm hoping to answer today.

01:34.080 --> 01:42.620
So isn't Judaism just Christianity without Jesus? What's the difference? Like, isn't the only real difference that Jews reject Christ?

01:42.620 --> 01:50.560
Isn't it just Christianity with more rules? Like, what you can and can't do? Like, eat bread during Passover.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.860
And what's the deal with the Jews crucifying our Lord and Savior?

01:57.120 --> 02:05.280
Right, so to answer the Jesus questions, we should probably start with addressing whether or not Jesus was a real history guy,

02:05.440 --> 02:09.220
or just made up, I guess.

02:09.220 --> 02:13.880
Um, so this is a quote from the book, New Testament History and Literature.

02:14.240 --> 02:19.680
The New Testament contains contradictory historical accounts of various parts of early Christianity.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.340
The account of the birth of Jesus and the origins of his family provided by Matthew

02:24.340 --> 02:26.340
is totally different from that in Luke,

02:26.800 --> 02:31.260
and any harmonization cannot stand up to the standards of modern historiography.

02:31.260 --> 02:34.260
The different narratives of his resurrection appearances,

02:34.880 --> 02:37.840
who of his disciples claimed they had seen him, when and where,

02:38.360 --> 02:41.240
and Mark, Matthew, Luke, and Paul all contradict one another.

02:42.020 --> 02:46.780
The New Testament is simply not a reliable source for the history of Jesus or early Christianity

02:46.780 --> 02:48.660
when taken at face value.

02:49.660 --> 02:53.820
This is a pretty common thing for ancient historical sources.

02:53.820 --> 02:58.100
They weren't interested in hard facts the same way that we are.

02:58.220 --> 03:05.900
They were more interested in presenting an interpretation of history in order to convey the right message.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.800
So if a kid asks you, what's electricity?

03:09.020 --> 03:10.320
How does electricity work?

03:10.400 --> 03:14.900
You might answer them, um, well, you know, there's, there's power in the walls,

03:14.900 --> 03:18.320
and the power goes through wires, and it makes machines work,

03:18.460 --> 03:22.480
because kids aren't going to understand electricity is the flow of electrons,

03:22.840 --> 03:29.340
and, uh, electrons flow from a higher to a lower voltage in order to reach equilibrium,

03:29.340 --> 03:35.100
and all that nonsense, and probably most of us don't really understand how electricity works either.

03:35.520 --> 03:40.740
So we present an interpretation of the facts in order to get a message across,

03:40.740 --> 03:43.740
and that is probably what the gospel authors were doing.

03:44.900 --> 03:48.920
And that's why there are some contradictions between accounts.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.360
Well, isn't it also because it was probably oral history and so forth?

03:53.620 --> 03:58.140
I mean, my brother and sister and I can get together and talk about something that happened 40 years ago.

03:59.180 --> 04:00.400
That too, it does.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.700
It doesn't mean a different memory.

04:01.840 --> 04:02.640
So it could be partly.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.940
Yeah, the Bible is probably part of it.

04:05.060 --> 04:06.140
It's not univocal.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.000
It's told by many voices.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.520
And so there's always going to be some differences in how people remember things,

04:13.620 --> 04:15.420
how people choose to tell a story.

04:16.860 --> 04:22.180
But yeah, that does make it a little bit more difficult to nail down the historicity of the gospel accounts.

04:23.200 --> 04:29.800
Okay, so what archaeological evidence do we have for the existence of Jesus as a historical figure?

04:29.800 --> 04:36.480
This is the first pretty much not-gospel evidence that we have for Jesus.

04:36.640 --> 04:42.940
It's called the Alex Aminos graffiti, and scholars date it to around 200 CE.

04:43.660 --> 04:46.540
I am sure that you cannot make out any of this.

04:46.540 --> 04:49.940
So, here's a sketch instead.

04:51.980 --> 04:59.080
We have a horse-headed man hanging on the cross with the inscription,

05:00.160 --> 05:02.260
Alex Aminos worships his God.

05:03.140 --> 05:11.780
This is a sort of derogatory graffiti making fun of this Christian for worshiping a God

05:11.780 --> 05:16.180
who was executed in a brutal and humiliating way.

05:16.540 --> 05:19.920
So, where was it found?

05:20.600 --> 05:24.700
Somewhere in the Roman Empire, but I believe the city of Rome itself.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.280
It's interesting that that's a Roman cross.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.140
It's not the cross that we have.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.360
It's a T-shaped cross.

05:33.360 --> 05:33.580
Yep.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.000
Yep.

05:36.600 --> 05:43.540
So, we know for sure that by 200 CE, there were some people going around worshiping a God

05:43.540 --> 05:46.560
who had been executed on a cross.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.220
They didn't give us a name or anything for this God, unfortunately,

05:50.480 --> 05:53.460
but we can be pretty sure that it's Jesus.

05:53.460 --> 06:04.660
We also have some non-Christian literary sources from the Jews in the Talmud.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.140
What is the Talmud?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.140
Who knows?

06:08.200 --> 06:08.760
What's the Talmud?

06:09.260 --> 06:09.840
You don't know.

06:09.920 --> 06:10.580
We're all in trouble.

06:10.580 --> 06:13.080
Is it an idol?

06:14.480 --> 06:14.700
Right?

06:14.960 --> 06:15.900
Not really.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.540
Is it a group of people?

06:18.540 --> 06:19.340
Are there the writings?

06:19.860 --> 06:21.020
Is the Talmud the writings?

06:22.520 --> 06:23.740
You have the prophets.

06:23.740 --> 06:30.380
Okay, so you're getting at something sort of different.

06:30.920 --> 06:37.080
So, the Hebrew scriptures or the Old Testament is divided into three sections.

06:37.080 --> 06:41.240
The law, the prophets, and the writings.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.960
The law or the Torah is the first five books.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.340
The five books of Moses or the Pentateuch.

06:48.340 --> 06:55.000
Then you have the prophets, the Nevi'im, we call them in Hebrew.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.400
And that's Isaiah and all those guys.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.400
And we have the writings, the Ketuvim.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.520
That's everything else.

07:04.620 --> 07:12.580
So, the Psalms, Song of Songs, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, all that stuff.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.440
But that's all in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament.

07:18.340 --> 07:21.320
Which we call the Tanakh, which is an acronym.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.220
Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim.

07:24.260 --> 07:32.480
After the Tanakh was sort of formalized, Jews kept on saying things and writing things.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.700
And we collected that into a volume called the Mishnah.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.620
And then they kept on saying things and commenting on the Mishnah.

07:39.620 --> 07:44.980
So, we compiled that into the Gemara, which is the commentary on the Mishnah.

07:45.180 --> 07:48.380
And the Mishnah and the Gemara together are called the Talmud.

07:48.940 --> 07:57.020
So, this was probably written down sometime after the Jews were kicked out of Israel the last time.

07:57.020 --> 08:01.800
So, before Moses separated the Red Sea?

08:02.480 --> 08:03.820
Long, long after.

08:04.300 --> 08:04.600
Okay.

08:05.940 --> 08:12.400
Moses was, if he existed, probably a couple thousand years BCE.

08:12.400 --> 08:17.500
And this probably would have been around, I don't know, 200 or so CE.

08:18.500 --> 08:23.400
Around the same time that the New Testament Gospels were being written down, we were writing down the Talmud.

08:24.620 --> 08:29.540
And so, that's just everybody's conversations and commentary on everybody else's conversations.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.720
It's commentaries on commentaries on commentaries.

08:31.720 --> 08:36.980
So, that's why the saying, like, you know, nine Jewish rabbis in a room, ten opinions.

08:38.340 --> 08:40.160
Yeah, two Jews, three opinions.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.740
There's actually a funny story.

08:44.680 --> 08:54.220
The Old Testament translation that Jesus had was called the Septuagint.

08:54.220 --> 08:59.940
It was a translation of the Hebrew into Aramaic, which was kind of the lingua franca of the time.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.980
All the Greeks, the Greek Jews spoke Aramaic.

09:03.780 --> 09:07.280
And it was considered at the time to be a miracle.

09:07.640 --> 09:13.580
Because the Greek authorities got, like, 70 rabbis in a room together.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.960
No, they got, they put 70 rabbis in 70 different rooms.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.660
And they weren't allowed to communicate.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.800
And they all came up with the same Aramaic translation.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.960
But the Jews said, if you want a real miracle, put them all in the same room.

09:26.960 --> 09:39.160
So, this is a story from the Talmud that might be talking about Jesus of Nazareth.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.820
And it goes like, so.

09:42.820 --> 09:49.880
So, on Passover Eve, they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning.

09:50.180 --> 09:53.760
And a crier went out before him for 40 days, publicly proclaiming,

09:54.200 --> 09:57.740
Jesus the Nazarene is going to be stoned because he practiced sorcery,

09:58.100 --> 10:01.080
incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray.

10:01.640 --> 10:06.260
Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.640
And the court did not find a reason to acquit him.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.820
And so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover Eve.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.500
Ola said, how can you understand this proof?

10:14.580 --> 10:18.420
Was Jesus the Nazarene worthy of conducting a search for a reason to acquit him?

10:18.500 --> 10:19.940
He was an insider to idol worship.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.300
And the merciful one states with regard to an insider to idol worship,

10:23.440 --> 10:25.760
neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.860
Rather, Jesus was different as he had close ties with the government

10:29.860 --> 10:33.020
and the Gentile authorities were interested in his acquittal.

10:33.020 --> 10:36.840
So, consequently, the court gave him every opportunity to clear himself

10:36.840 --> 10:39.700
so that it could not be claimed that he was falsely convicted.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.460
What the heck is going on here?

10:44.200 --> 10:48.700
So this story is really about, um, stay,

10:49.460 --> 10:51.780
about due process in Jewish law.

10:52.660 --> 10:55.560
There is this guy called Jesus the Nazarene,

10:55.560 --> 10:59.420
and the Jews are going to execute him for practicing sorcery

10:59.420 --> 11:01.760
and inciting the Jews to idol worship.

11:03.620 --> 11:06.880
And it describes a sort of due process

11:06.880 --> 11:10.000
that the Jews give to Jesus the Nazarene

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
where they have a guy go out and say,

11:13.260 --> 11:15.300
hey, this guy is on trial.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.300
He's about to be executed.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.780
Anyone who has evidence to help him

11:19.780 --> 11:22.760
should definitely come forward before he dies.

11:22.760 --> 11:28.040
And this rabbi, Ulla, is saying,

11:28.600 --> 11:29.760
why did we do this?

11:30.800 --> 11:34.240
Insiders to idol worship are not supposed to get any sort of due process.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.500
We're supposed to just kill them according to our law.

11:36.840 --> 11:37.960
So what's the deal?

11:38.760 --> 11:39.900
And the answer is,

11:40.440 --> 11:44.600
Jesus was very close to the Gentile authorities,

11:44.760 --> 11:45.560
the Roman government.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.220
So if we just killed him,

11:48.620 --> 11:50.120
that would look bad for us,

11:50.180 --> 11:51.820
and we might get in trouble with the Romans.

11:51.820 --> 11:55.680
So that's why we had a crier go out ahead of time.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.820
This does not sound like the gospel accounts of the crucifixion.

11:59.460 --> 11:59.800
No.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.900
I mean, the Jews hang him on Passover Eve.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.080
That doesn't make any sense

12:05.080 --> 12:07.940
because Jesus was crucified after Passover.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.540
Jesus was not that close to the Gentile authorities,

12:11.740 --> 12:11.820
considering...

12:12.860 --> 12:13.820
They didn't like him.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.980
They kneeled him to a cross, etc., etc.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.160
So, what do we do with this?

12:21.200 --> 12:22.620
Is this evidence of Jesus or not?

12:22.700 --> 12:23.300
We don't know.

12:23.300 --> 12:29.660
Here's another Talmudic story about someone named Jesus.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.480
What is the word on top?

12:33.180 --> 12:36.100
This is the book of the Talmud that it comes from,

12:36.240 --> 12:38.940
and this is the page that it's on.

12:38.940 --> 12:45.300
So, it's kind of like Matthew 7, 9, something like that.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.760
Was Sanhedrin a person?

12:47.640 --> 12:49.320
The Sanhedrin is the Jewish court,

12:49.480 --> 12:50.900
so this is the volume of the Talmud

12:50.900 --> 12:55.520
that deals with the discussions upon discussions

12:55.520 --> 12:58.180
about the Jewish court,

12:58.720 --> 13:02.960
and most of it has nothing to do with the Sanhedrin, actually.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.660
But that's a story for another time.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.980
Yehoshua ben Prechaia said,

13:11.800 --> 13:13.620
How beautiful is this inn?

13:14.240 --> 13:15.900
Jesus, his students, said to him,

13:16.340 --> 13:19.880
But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper's wife are narrow.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.720
Yehoshua said to him,

13:22.980 --> 13:23.940
Look in one!

13:24.480 --> 13:27.280
Do not involve yourself with regard to that manner,

13:27.400 --> 13:28.960
the appearance of a married woman.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.660
So he produced 400 shoferot and ostracized him.

13:32.960 --> 13:38.100
So these guys, Yehoshua and his student Jesus,

13:38.600 --> 13:39.620
go to an inn.

13:39.740 --> 13:41.500
Yehoshua says, This inn is awesome.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.380
And Jesus says,

13:44.060 --> 13:46.140
Yeah, and the innkeeper's wife is kind of a looker, right?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.680
That's what eyes are narrow means?

13:50.680 --> 13:55.340
Yeah, she looks like a bit of a loose woman.

13:55.340 --> 13:58.880
I'm like, my eyes are narrow.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.240
So Yehoshua says,

14:04.320 --> 14:06.580
What are you doing commenting on the appearance of a married woman?

14:06.700 --> 14:08.340
Get out of here, you're ostracized.

14:08.460 --> 14:09.160
We shun you.

14:09.160 --> 14:14.220
What's 400 shofar?

14:14.940 --> 14:21.200
A shofar is the horn that we blow at certain ritual occasions.

14:21.660 --> 14:29.120
So he gets 400 people who blow shofar to officially ostracize him from the Jewish community.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.400
And everybody knows it because we had 400 shofar out.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.940
So he's kicked out.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.180
He's pretty much kicked out for this.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.080
Excluded from the community.

14:39.180 --> 14:43.840
So maybe we should just say that Jesus is a very common name.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.520
That is true.

14:46.680 --> 14:50.480
This could be anybody's guess who this person is.

14:50.480 --> 14:58.660
Jesus came before Yehoshua several times and said to him,

14:58.860 --> 15:00.340
Accept my repentance.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.920
Yehoshua took no notice of him.

15:03.520 --> 15:09.540
One day Yehoshua was reciting the Shema, the central prayer in Judaism, one of them.

15:10.620 --> 15:13.080
And Jesus came before him with the same request.

15:13.740 --> 15:19.020
Yehoshua intended to accept his request and signaled him with his hand to wait until he completed his prayer.

15:19.020 --> 15:21.320
It's against Jewish law to interrupt the Shema.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.480
Because it's very important.

15:24.060 --> 15:27.680
So Jesus approaches him while he's reciting and he says,

15:27.780 --> 15:28.440
Hold on a second.

15:28.980 --> 15:31.480
But Jesus didn't understand the signal and thought,

15:31.620 --> 15:32.820
He's driving me away.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.920
So he went and stood a brick upright to serve as an idol and bowed down to it.

15:38.680 --> 15:39.960
Yehoshua then said to Jesus,

15:40.140 --> 15:40.620
Repent!

15:41.040 --> 15:42.020
And Jesus said to him,

15:42.600 --> 15:45.320
This is the tradition that I received from you.

15:45.320 --> 15:50.540
Whoever sins and causes the masses to sin is not given the opportunity to repent.

15:51.660 --> 15:52.900
And the master says,

15:52.980 --> 15:56.080
Jesus performed sorcery inside of the Jews to engage in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.460
Jews today use this story as an example of how not to treat people.

16:05.460 --> 16:10.780
Often we will say that this was Jesus, Jesus.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.300
Even if the facts don't quite line up.

16:13.460 --> 16:21.500
And we'll say that Jesus went off and started his own religion because one of our rabbis was a jerk and wouldn't take his repentance.

16:22.300 --> 16:25.580
And that's what Jesus says here when he says,

16:25.580 --> 16:28.840
Yehoshua says repent, and Jesus says,

16:29.240 --> 16:33.960
Look, I learned from you that even if I try to repent, you're not going to accept it.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.200
So why should I even bother with you anymore?

16:37.300 --> 16:37.760
You're a jerk.

16:39.780 --> 16:42.860
But is this the Jesus of the New Testament?

16:43.100 --> 16:43.880
I don't know.

16:43.880 --> 16:48.420
So, Evelyn, in this prayer that you just said,

16:49.260 --> 16:51.200
they say, Lord.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.120
Who is the Lord that they're talking about?

16:54.940 --> 16:59.660
The word there in the Hebrew is the Tetragrammaton,

16:59.800 --> 17:00.540
Yad-Heh-Vav-Heh.

17:00.760 --> 17:05.740
This is the name that God gave to Moses at the burning bush to identify himself.

17:05.740 --> 17:15.580
But we don't say that name, so we use a substitution, Adonai, and that's generally translated as Lord.

17:16.920 --> 17:25.460
So, in the Jewish religion, we believe in God, but not Jesus, as our Savior.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.320
That's pretty much what we're trying to answer.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.120
We don't accept him as the Messiah,

17:31.120 --> 17:37.920
but we're also not really sure if he was even a real historical guy

17:37.920 --> 17:42.580
or if the Gospel accounts happened as they're written or, you know.

17:45.460 --> 17:48.340
And why do we not accept Jesus?

17:48.500 --> 17:49.860
What do we really think about him?

17:51.400 --> 17:55.700
Well, to answer that, I will pose to you a question.

17:57.900 --> 18:01.060
Who do you prefer, Rabbi Hillel or Rabbi Shammai?

18:01.120 --> 18:05.620
Don't know the dude.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.800
Yeah, you don't know the dude.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.900
We don't really think about Jesus that much, honestly.

18:11.280 --> 18:17.220
I think there's a sort of misconception that Jews just really are against Jesus,

18:17.580 --> 18:19.620
but kind of just don't care.

18:21.340 --> 18:25.220
I personally think that Jesus, as he's presented in the Gospels,

18:25.220 --> 18:28.660
was a brilliant, radical reformer,

18:28.660 --> 18:32.820
and that the Jews could probably listen to him here and there.

18:34.100 --> 18:39.080
But the whole, like, Messiah, Son of God thing,

18:39.620 --> 18:43.760
it's a little bit odd.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.820
So Jews don't believe in the Holy Trinity.

18:46.980 --> 18:48.880
Where does the Holy Spirit come in here?

18:49.260 --> 18:50.080
The Holy Spirit.

18:50.080 --> 18:58.840
I mean, everybody has the breath of God within them.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.780
Are you going to, at some point,

19:04.020 --> 19:05.980
because I don't want to get in the way of your narrative,

19:06.160 --> 19:08.420
but are you going to talk about some of the differences,

19:08.580 --> 19:11.980
like the differences in terms of belief in an eternal life,

19:12.120 --> 19:13.660
or that sort of thing?

19:13.660 --> 19:15.760
Was I going to?

19:15.940 --> 19:16.780
Maybe, maybe not.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.620
Write it down, add it to your list.

19:19.660 --> 19:21.860
So it's Hillel and Shammai.

19:22.140 --> 19:23.200
You don't know who they are?

19:23.440 --> 19:24.180
Why do you care?

19:26.200 --> 19:26.600
Yeah.

19:27.220 --> 19:28.740
Hillel founded a society.

19:29.700 --> 19:30.640
The Hillel Society.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.760
I don't think he founded that.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.440
He did invent the sandwich, allegedly.

19:36.440 --> 19:44.040
I do want to address this question, though.

19:44.220 --> 19:47.280
Differences in belief like the afterlife and such.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.260
Afterlife is a tricky question,

19:50.420 --> 19:55.260
because it's not directly addressed in the Tanakh,

19:55.520 --> 19:56.300
the Hebrew scriptures.

19:58.140 --> 20:03.260
So in the Tanakh,

20:03.260 --> 20:06.540
the closest that we get to is a place called Sheol.

20:07.260 --> 20:08.720
Translates to grave,

20:09.040 --> 20:11.680
described as a dark, watery place underground.

20:12.620 --> 20:13.600
So according to the Tanakh,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.260
when you die, you get buried.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.620
And that's about as far as we get.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.080
After the Tanakh,

20:20.280 --> 20:23.360
we have come up with various different theories.

20:23.620 --> 20:25.800
One of them is the idea of the world to come.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.640
This is pretty analogous to what Jesus would have called

20:28.640 --> 20:29.640
the kingdom of God.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.860
Some sort of utopian future

20:31.860 --> 20:35.240
in which things will not suck.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.940
And maybe some of us will come back to life.

20:40.060 --> 20:41.120
Maybe some of us won't.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.360
Some people believed in the resurrection.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.300
Some didn't.

20:45.380 --> 20:48.180
The Apostle Paul actually manages to escape

20:48.180 --> 20:49.560
from persecution once

20:49.560 --> 20:51.600
by bringing up bodily resurrection.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.620
And then all the Jews start arguing with each other

20:53.620 --> 20:54.680
and he kind of just slips away.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.380
Some Jews today believe in reincarnation.

21:00.380 --> 21:04.680
There's no real agreement.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.540
Who were these people?

21:09.520 --> 21:13.200
Hillel and Shammai were two very popular rabbis

21:13.200 --> 21:14.080
back in the day.

21:15.860 --> 21:16.520
What did it?

21:17.880 --> 21:19.140
I don't know.

21:19.140 --> 21:23.820
Nobody knows the mythical time of

21:23.820 --> 21:26.220
when we tell stories about the sages.

21:26.880 --> 21:27.960
No one knows.

21:29.040 --> 21:29.820
But they, yes?

21:30.060 --> 21:31.460
The question is,

21:32.600 --> 21:34.540
the Gospels were written like,

21:34.940 --> 21:36.240
say, a hundred years or so

21:36.240 --> 21:39.640
after the death of Jesus.

21:40.020 --> 21:40.280
Yes.

21:40.280 --> 21:43.820
Now, when was this written and stuff?

21:44.200 --> 21:46.400
I mean, is everything just open to interpretations

21:46.400 --> 21:49.780
from who's ever writing whatever, you know?

21:49.860 --> 21:51.440
The Talmud was probably written

21:51.440 --> 21:53.480
about the same time as the Gospels.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.740
So everything takes place

21:56.740 --> 21:58.640
hundreds of years after the fact.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.740
So it's just whatever the people,

22:01.680 --> 22:01.920
you know,

22:01.960 --> 22:03.880
oh, well, so-and-so said this or that.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.700
And they don't actually know.

22:05.860 --> 22:06.060
I mean.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.400
Whatever message that they're trying to get across

22:08.400 --> 22:09.920
is what they write down.

22:09.920 --> 22:10.840
They didn't have cell phones to them.

22:12.140 --> 22:12.900
And the internet.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.380
And most people were not very literate,

22:15.440 --> 22:16.760
so they couldn't have written things down.

22:17.020 --> 22:17.180
Right.

22:17.180 --> 22:20.420
We think that Paul was illiterate

22:20.420 --> 22:21.920
and dictated all his letters.

22:22.820 --> 22:24.460
Actually, I think we know that for sure

22:24.460 --> 22:27.460
because he says in the preamble to the letters,

22:28.120 --> 22:28.640
I'm Paul,

22:28.740 --> 22:30.200
and this was written down by so-and-so.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.140
But yeah, Hillel and Shammai

22:33.140 --> 22:34.660
had two competing schools of thought,

22:34.860 --> 22:37.000
and Hillel won pretty much every single argument.

22:38.120 --> 22:41.200
And we only remember Shammai as a loser.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.140
We've accepted that we can't know for sure

22:46.140 --> 22:47.280
if Jesus was real or not.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.440
Plenty of people are willing to just say,

22:50.700 --> 22:51.460
yeah, he probably did.

22:54.620 --> 22:58.800
What was Jesus's relationship with Jews?

22:59.680 --> 23:00.580
So to understand that,

23:00.640 --> 23:01.600
we're going to go through

23:01.600 --> 23:04.360
what did Judaism look like in Jesus's day?

23:04.720 --> 23:07.280
So Jesus was around during the second temple.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.640
The first temple was destroyed

23:08.640 --> 23:10.480
many long time ago.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.660
And then the Jews came back to Israel

23:13.660 --> 23:15.400
after some time away,

23:15.400 --> 23:16.460
built a second temple.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.780
And that's where Jesus is going all the time

23:19.780 --> 23:21.500
whenever he goes to Jerusalem.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.060
We have three main factions,

23:24.240 --> 23:26.220
the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Zealots.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.520
You might recognize some of these guys

23:28.520 --> 23:30.020
from many of the Jesus stories.

23:30.860 --> 23:35.060
So the Sadducees are the priestly class.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.240
They run the temple.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.420
They're in charge of the temple sacrifices.

23:38.420 --> 23:44.860
They got into power because of a revolt earlier

23:44.860 --> 23:46.720
when they kicked the Greeks out of the temple.

23:47.340 --> 23:49.480
So they kind of have some political status.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.240
And they work together with the Romans

23:52.240 --> 23:55.720
because they have political status.

23:55.860 --> 23:59.400
They want the Romans to not take that away from them.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.660
They're very interested in maintaining the status quo.

24:03.840 --> 24:09.300
The Pharisees are a faction that came out of the exile

24:09.300 --> 24:10.980
in between the first and second temple.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.740
So Judaism was pretty centered around the temple

24:15.740 --> 24:18.520
until the exile when the temple was destroyed.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.400
And they couldn't really do temple stuff anymore.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.440
So they had to figure out,

24:21.940 --> 24:24.100
how do we stay Jews in exile?

24:24.100 --> 24:28.140
So they invented this form of portable Judaism

24:28.140 --> 24:31.160
that was less focused on the temple rituals

24:31.160 --> 24:33.760
and more focused on the Torah,

24:34.020 --> 24:36.280
obeying the commands, personal piety.

24:37.360 --> 24:40.400
This resulted in a decentralization of practice.

24:40.640 --> 24:45.020
We didn't have to necessarily rely on the temple.

24:46.140 --> 24:48.820
And they are a separatist faction

24:48.820 --> 24:51.200
because they're so focused on the law,

24:51.200 --> 24:54.120
they sort of isolate themselves.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.360
They don't hang out with non-Pharisees very much.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.700
They definitely will not eat at the same table as a Gentile

25:00.700 --> 25:03.180
because who knows what Gentiles are eating.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.420
It might not be kosher.

25:04.780 --> 25:08.440
They might be praying to idols at that table, et cetera.

25:09.380 --> 25:14.180
And then the Zealots are the anti-Roman guerrilla fighters.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.880
They lived up in the Judean hill country

25:17.880 --> 25:21.060
and would just get together and go attack some Romans.

25:21.200 --> 25:21.920
Every now and then.

25:23.340 --> 25:24.620
When would this have been?

25:25.080 --> 25:26.660
This would have been around the time of Jesus,

25:26.820 --> 25:30.320
probably around, I think we're talking 20 CE.

25:33.780 --> 25:36.140
The second temple was destroyed in the year 70.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.540
So around 0 to 70-ish CE.

25:40.540 --> 25:45.720
Was there a connection between the Zealots and Masada?

25:46.820 --> 25:47.020
Who?

25:47.500 --> 25:52.420
Masada, the fortification that the Romans took.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.680
I haven't read my Josephus enough, so I'm not...

25:57.680 --> 26:00.020
When you talk about the second temple,

26:00.200 --> 26:03.700
were those described as big temples in Jerusalem?

26:03.700 --> 26:04.420
Is this one like the...

26:04.420 --> 26:05.280
Yes.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.280
Like the golden one?

26:07.280 --> 26:12.120
So the first temple that I refer to is the Temple of Solomon.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.220
It's the central location of Jewish worship

26:17.220 --> 26:19.320
from the time of Solomon

26:19.320 --> 26:24.300
throughout the whole Old Testament, basically.

26:24.300 --> 26:29.060
Solomon is described to have built an enormous temple

26:29.060 --> 26:31.220
with a lot of gold and a lot of stuff.

26:31.380 --> 26:34.760
And then the Babylonians come in and knock that down.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.640
And a while later, the Persians say,

26:38.940 --> 26:40.840
you're allowed to go back and build a new one.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.860
It's not quite as impressive as the first one.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.860
And the people who remember the first one

26:45.860 --> 26:47.660
start crying because it's so lame

26:47.660 --> 26:48.900
compared to what they remember.

26:48.900 --> 26:55.460
And then the Romans knocked that one down,

26:55.680 --> 26:56.840
and now there's no temple.

26:57.540 --> 26:57.940
Okay.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.220
So it's the one temple.

27:02.060 --> 27:02.440
Yes.

27:03.240 --> 27:03.860
One temple.

27:04.120 --> 27:04.360
Okay.

27:06.600 --> 27:07.980
Unless you're a Samaritan

27:07.980 --> 27:09.100
because they had a different temple,

27:09.320 --> 27:11.820
but that's a whole other conversation.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.860
Any other questions?

27:15.520 --> 27:18.780
So this is way before they did the Golden Dome?

27:19.420 --> 27:19.720
Temple?

27:20.720 --> 27:22.500
Yeah, that's a Muslim temple.

27:22.820 --> 27:23.960
The Al-Waksim Mosque.

27:24.180 --> 27:24.440
Yeah.

27:24.840 --> 27:25.380
My bad.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.580
What was Jesus' relationship to all these guys?

27:28.940 --> 27:32.360
We can probably guess that the Pharisees and Sadducees

27:32.360 --> 27:34.700
weren't too fond of him if you've read your Gospels

27:34.700 --> 27:35.940
because they're always trying to trick him

27:35.940 --> 27:37.400
into saying silly things.

27:38.140 --> 27:40.120
So let's start with some stories.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.620
Then they came to Jerusalem,

27:42.620 --> 27:44.980
and he, Jesus, entered the temple

27:44.980 --> 27:47.180
and began to drive out those who were selling

27:47.180 --> 27:48.980
and those who were buying in the temple,

27:49.560 --> 27:51.620
and he overturned the tables of the money changers

27:51.620 --> 27:53.340
and the seats of those who sold doves,

27:53.720 --> 27:54.880
and he would not allow anyone

27:54.880 --> 27:56.400
to carry anything through the temple.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.100
He was teaching and saying,

27:58.280 --> 27:59.040
Is it not written,

27:59.180 --> 28:00.740
My house shall be called a house of prayer

28:00.740 --> 28:01.880
for all the nations?

28:01.880 --> 28:04.620
But you have made it a den of robbers.

28:05.220 --> 28:06.940
And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.180
they kept looking for a way to kill him,

28:09.600 --> 28:10.720
for they were afraid of him,

28:10.860 --> 28:13.820
because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching.

28:15.340 --> 28:16.600
It makes sense.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.880
It does make sense.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.460
We're probably talking about the Sadducees here

28:20.460 --> 28:21.460
because it's the temple,

28:21.640 --> 28:23.620
and the Sadducees control the temple cult.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.300
And they are being,

28:26.740 --> 28:28.740
Judy mentioned them earlier today,

28:28.960 --> 28:33.160
saying that they're charging for money conversion.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.780
They're charging for the sacrifices that you have to make.

28:37.140 --> 28:38.080
They're not optional.

28:38.340 --> 28:39.040
They are mandatory.

28:40.020 --> 28:41.540
Everyone's skimming off the top.

28:42.140 --> 28:45.000
And Jesus is not okay with the Sadducees

28:45.000 --> 28:49.240
profiting off of mandatory religious ritual.

28:49.240 --> 28:54.380
So he thinks that everyone should be able to participate

28:54.380 --> 28:56.360
in temple sacrifice,

28:56.500 --> 28:58.380
whether they can afford to or not.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.440
So he comes in and says,

29:00.560 --> 29:01.600
You guys are a bunch of jerks.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.540
I'm flipping your tables.

29:06.700 --> 29:10.260
So there's clearly bad blood between Jesus and the Sadducees.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.940
Next we have Jesus and the Pharisees.

29:15.860 --> 29:18.240
And as Jesus sat at dinner in the house,

29:18.240 --> 29:20.380
many tax collectors and sinners came

29:20.380 --> 29:22.200
and were sitting with Jesus and his disciples.

29:22.740 --> 29:24.200
When the Pharisees saw this,

29:24.560 --> 29:25.680
he said to his disciples,

29:26.220 --> 29:28.880
Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?

29:29.480 --> 29:31.180
But when he heard this, he said,

29:31.720 --> 29:34.200
Those who are well have no need of a physician,

29:34.400 --> 29:35.480
but those who are sick.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.620
Go and learn what this means.

29:38.060 --> 29:40.220
I desire mercy, not sacrifice.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.500
For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.

29:43.500 --> 29:49.280
So we talked earlier about how Pharisees won't eat with non-Pharisees

29:49.280 --> 29:53.380
because they're worried about becoming ritually impure

29:53.380 --> 29:56.320
or accidentally eating non-kosher food,

29:56.400 --> 29:58.160
food that might have been sacrificed to idols.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.440
So they see Jesus eating with these people,

30:01.640 --> 30:02.820
tax collectors and sinners.

30:02.820 --> 30:07.980
I always think it's funny that tax collectors are lumped in.

30:11.280 --> 30:15.860
The historical reason for that is that tax collectors worked with and for the Romans,

30:16.100 --> 30:20.420
and they usually would not take Jewish law very seriously.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.020
They were pretty assimilated to Roman culture.

30:23.020 --> 30:26.440
They were considered, like, traitors.

30:27.020 --> 30:29.360
Okay, so the Pharisees are very focused on the law,

30:29.840 --> 30:30.740
the book of the law.

30:31.380 --> 30:34.760
But Jesus here is quoting from the prophets, like Isaiah,

30:35.740 --> 30:37.840
in which God says,

30:39.400 --> 30:42.340
Your sacrifices are meaningless to me.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.660
Your festivals are repugnant.

30:45.860 --> 30:49.860
The sacrifice that I want is for you to take care of the poor,

30:49.860 --> 30:50.720
the widow, and the orphan.

30:50.720 --> 30:55.500
Jesus took this message to heart and preached it quite regularly.

30:56.760 --> 31:01.700
And so he's kind of calling the Pharisees out for being very hoity-toity,

31:01.880 --> 31:05.960
but not actually doing anything useful that is actually helping anybody.

31:10.920 --> 31:13.740
We've got quite a few of them people in our society now,

31:13.840 --> 31:15.900
and Jesus needs to come and talk to them again.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.380
That's an understatement.

31:20.720 --> 31:21.760
Yeah.

31:26.560 --> 31:34.120
And we have a story that deals a little bit with his relationship with the zealots.

31:34.120 --> 31:39.500
Then they, meaning the authorities, the Jewish authorities,

31:40.160 --> 31:44.680
sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.120
And they came and said to him,

31:46.580 --> 31:50.480
Teacher, we know that you are sincere and show deference to no one,

31:50.600 --> 31:52.840
for you do not regard people with partiality,

31:52.960 --> 31:55.840
but teach the way of God in accordance with truth.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.600
Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?

32:00.100 --> 32:02.360
Should we pay them or should we not?

32:02.360 --> 32:04.800
But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them,

32:05.080 --> 32:06.960
Why are you putting me to the test?

32:07.400 --> 32:09.440
Bring me a denarius and let me see it.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.680
And they brought one.

32:11.000 --> 32:11.860
And he said to them,

32:12.280 --> 32:15.160
Whose head is this and whose title?

32:15.760 --> 32:17.160
They answered, Caesar's.

32:17.700 --> 32:18.540
Jesus said to them,

32:18.660 --> 32:23.160
Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.

32:23.460 --> 32:24.960
They were utterly amazed at him.

32:24.960 --> 32:30.040
So they're trying to catch him in a trap where if he says,

32:30.260 --> 32:32.920
Yes, we should pay our taxes, then he's a Roman shill.

32:33.780 --> 32:37.100
And if he says, No, we should not pay our taxes,

32:37.760 --> 32:40.640
then they can get him in trouble with the Roman government.

32:40.860 --> 32:44.740
So either way, he's between a rock and a hard place.

32:44.740 --> 32:48.540
But he pulls this maneuver where he says,

32:49.080 --> 32:51.080
Look, it's George Washington's face on the quarter.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.620
God doesn't care about this.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.100
The money is already his.

32:57.180 --> 32:58.140
Just give it back to him.

32:59.340 --> 33:05.920
So he's clearly rejecting the sort of militaristic, anti-Roman position of the Zealots.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.920
What are the Herodians?

33:08.920 --> 33:13.240
Herodians, they're the faction of King Herod,

33:13.860 --> 33:19.360
who was put into power after the Maccabean Revolt,

33:20.000 --> 33:23.060
which was the same revolt that put the Sadducees in power.

33:23.760 --> 33:28.540
So he's pretty much referring to the Sadducees in a roundabout way.

33:31.660 --> 33:33.260
So people higher up.

33:33.780 --> 33:34.100
Yes.

33:34.820 --> 33:37.040
So Jesus had strong words for everybody.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.380
He was very radical,

33:39.580 --> 33:43.220
very interested in reforming the Jewish community into something better.

33:43.660 --> 33:46.540
Are the Jews responsible for killing Jesus?

33:49.160 --> 33:55.140
This has been a thing that Jews have had to deal with for the last 2,000 years,

33:56.040 --> 33:57.920
being called the Christ killers.

33:57.920 --> 34:02.480
According to this book,

34:04.180 --> 34:06.260
Jesus was executed by a crucifixion,

34:06.340 --> 34:09.300
which was a common method of torture and execution used by the Romans.

34:10.020 --> 34:12.340
So the execution of Jesus was a Roman affair,

34:12.760 --> 34:15.600
possibly with the cooperation of Jewish leadership in Jerusalem.

34:16.180 --> 34:20.860
The Romans did not need to try a troublesome Jewish peasant in order to kill him.

34:20.860 --> 34:26.760
They tortured and crucified nameless lower class people all the time in order to get rid of Jesus,

34:26.860 --> 34:28.240
who had caused a disturbance in the temple,

34:28.680 --> 34:31.760
had made radical sounding pronouncements and prophecies,

34:31.880 --> 34:34.280
and was rumored to have aspirations to kingship.

34:34.800 --> 34:38.100
The Romans would have simply taken him by force and crucified him the next day,

34:38.200 --> 34:40.500
along with a few others they were getting rid of.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.200
There was no need for any trial,

34:42.360 --> 34:44.840
much less two or more before different courts

34:44.840 --> 34:48.980
would have been more trouble than a Roman government needed for the desired result.

34:48.980 --> 34:54.380
So the gospel narratives are a little bit confusing

34:54.380 --> 34:57.580
in the context of the actual political reality of the time.

34:58.060 --> 35:03.200
It seems like all the rigmarole was completely unnecessary.

35:04.140 --> 35:07.100
But I like to take literature seriously anyways.

35:07.960 --> 35:11.500
So if we read the gospel accounts and what they say,

35:12.560 --> 35:17.280
we can just say that they happen pretty much

35:17.280 --> 35:19.280
the way that they're written down

35:19.280 --> 35:22.000
and still get some information out of them.

35:22.840 --> 35:27.840
There's a few threads common to all of the gospel accounts.

35:28.100 --> 35:30.820
Some differences, but there are some commonalities.

35:32.040 --> 35:36.500
First one is that in all of the accounts,

35:37.060 --> 35:44.400
Jesus is captured by the Romans in collaboration with the Sadducees

35:44.400 --> 35:48.840
because he is a threat to their power

35:48.840 --> 35:53.260
and the institutions, political institutions that they're a part of.

35:54.260 --> 35:57.640
He is directly flipping over their tables and such

35:57.640 --> 36:03.220
and calling for reform, trying to take away their sources of revenue.

36:04.300 --> 36:06.380
Does anyone know who Barabbas is?

36:06.380 --> 36:09.380
It was the alternative.

36:10.200 --> 36:10.640
Yes.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.000
Yes.

36:13.380 --> 36:13.680
Yes.

36:15.300 --> 36:19.020
In the gospel accounts, when Jesus is brought before Pilate,

36:19.100 --> 36:20.080
the governor of Judea,

36:20.380 --> 36:26.640
apparently there is a tradition around Passover

36:26.640 --> 36:29.220
when the governor would pardon one criminal,

36:29.840 --> 36:31.300
whoever the Jews chose.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.240
This is an outrageous tradition.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.340
There's no way this happened.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.460
It's kind of like Prima Nocta and Braveheart,

36:36.560 --> 36:37.240
if you've seen that.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.280
It's very good storytelling,

36:41.480 --> 36:42.840
but it probably didn't happen.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.380
So there's Jesus and there's Barabbas,

36:46.760 --> 36:48.180
who is the other criminal.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.740
He's described as a murderer and a seditionist.

36:51.740 --> 36:55.820
And the Jews say,

36:56.040 --> 36:56.940
we want Barabbas.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.240
Free that guy.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.400
Barabbas is not a real name.

37:01.780 --> 37:02.660
It's Aramaic.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.200
Bar-Abbas, son of the father,

37:06.500 --> 37:09.780
which is completely meaningless.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
It basically just means a person.

37:13.000 --> 37:20.020
We can contrast that with the name that Jesus used for himself,

37:20.260 --> 37:20.900
son of man,

37:21.080 --> 37:22.780
which is completely meaningless

37:22.780 --> 37:25.480
and basically just means a person.

37:26.380 --> 37:29.300
So the gospel narratives are creating this dichotomy

37:29.300 --> 37:31.420
between Jesus and Barabbas,

37:32.100 --> 37:35.180
who are their names are meant to be similar,

37:35.900 --> 37:37.300
to call our attention to them.

37:37.300 --> 37:41.540
Jesus is this peace-loving pacifist.

37:41.940 --> 37:44.240
He is submitting himself to execution.

37:45.420 --> 37:46.900
The gospel of John says,

37:47.320 --> 37:48.960
I could free myself if I wanted.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.480
I could have my followers storm this place and free me,

37:52.620 --> 37:53.900
but I'm not going to do that

37:53.900 --> 37:59.360
because my kingdom is a kingdom of peace.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.360
It's a kingdom of the last coming first,

38:02.360 --> 38:04.640
the mighty being brought low.

38:04.640 --> 38:09.020
Meanwhile, Barabbas is an insurrectionist and a murderer.

38:09.260 --> 38:11.100
He's one of the zealots probably

38:11.100 --> 38:15.180
going around trying to gain Jewish independence

38:15.180 --> 38:16.840
from Rome by violent means.

38:17.480 --> 38:22.060
So the story is saying the Jews chose violence

38:22.060 --> 38:27.160
rather than the way of peace that Jesus was teaching.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.260
And I think that's probably the message

38:32.260 --> 38:35.640
that the Jews of the first century would have heard.

38:37.540 --> 38:40.760
So, yeah.

38:42.700 --> 38:46.780
We also know that Jesus was a victim

38:46.780 --> 38:48.840
of sort of a mob mentality

38:48.840 --> 38:50.520
in all of the gospel accounts.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.420
It's the Sadducees who start up

38:53.420 --> 38:55.140
the crucified Jesus chants

38:55.140 --> 38:57.160
and everybody kind of just goes along.

38:58.000 --> 38:58.920
I don't know if anyone here

38:58.920 --> 39:00.320
has seen the movie Borat.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.300
But if you have,

39:03.380 --> 39:05.060
you've seen Sacha Baron Cohen

39:05.060 --> 39:06.320
pretending to be a foreigner

39:06.320 --> 39:08.140
going up and saying things like,

39:08.520 --> 39:10.160
we support your war of terror.

39:10.880 --> 39:14.460
We support killing every single man,

39:14.580 --> 39:16.460
woman, and child in Iraq.

39:16.660 --> 39:18.760
And all the people start cheering

39:18.760 --> 39:19.840
and going along with it.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.760
So it's pretty easy to get a mob

39:21.760 --> 39:22.860
to agree with almost anything.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.580
And again,

39:25.880 --> 39:27.940
Roman execution,

39:29.040 --> 39:32.780
the historicity of whether or not

39:32.780 --> 39:33.780
the Jews were allowed

39:33.780 --> 39:35.060
to administer capital punishment

39:35.060 --> 39:36.220
is in question.

39:36.460 --> 39:38.260
But according to the gospel narratives,

39:38.360 --> 39:38.820
they couldn't,

39:38.880 --> 39:40.160
and that's why they had to bring him

39:40.160 --> 39:41.700
to the Romans.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.060
But pretty clearly,

39:46.280 --> 39:46.640
okay,

39:47.060 --> 39:49.280
so how is Judaism different from Christianity?

39:50.280 --> 39:52.360
Jews are more focused on action than belief.

39:52.860 --> 39:58.220
nobody cares really

39:58.220 --> 39:59.860
if a Jew believes in God or not.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.200
There are a ton of atheist Jews

40:02.200 --> 40:04.580
who are still Jewish

40:04.580 --> 40:06.500
and still very accepted as Jews.

40:07.060 --> 40:08.600
What we care about is

40:08.600 --> 40:11.760
being a good person,

40:12.600 --> 40:14.380
obeying the laws maybe.

40:15.340 --> 40:17.580
Depending on what that means to you,

40:17.700 --> 40:19.520
there are a lot of different positions.

40:19.520 --> 40:23.380
I think for Christians,

40:23.540 --> 40:24.800
mostly there is a lot more

40:24.800 --> 40:26.880
emphasis on belief.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.740
You are expected to believe in Jesus,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.320
believe in the resurrection.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.840
There's a bunch of creeds

40:35.840 --> 40:36.760
like the Apostles' Creed,

40:36.880 --> 40:37.560
the Nicene Creed.

40:37.720 --> 40:38.660
You might know of those.

40:40.460 --> 40:42.020
Many, many Christians

40:42.020 --> 40:43.060
were burned at the stake

40:43.060 --> 40:44.200
by Christian authorities

40:44.200 --> 40:46.360
for having

40:46.360 --> 40:48.120
some heretical beliefs.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.500
Judy would have been

40:50.500 --> 40:51.240
burned at the stake

40:51.240 --> 40:52.540
if she was a believer.

40:53.540 --> 40:54.980
I wouldn't have laughed so long.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.180
That's great.

40:57.740 --> 40:59.460
Christianity is generally considered

40:59.460 --> 41:01.020
to be a pretty individual affair.

41:01.180 --> 41:02.280
It's between you and Jesus.

41:02.280 --> 41:07.740
Judaism is a group activity.

41:08.140 --> 41:10.040
You cannot be Jewish by yourself.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.120
Say what?

41:12.580 --> 41:14.800
You cannot be Jewish by yourself.

41:15.700 --> 41:16.820
It's cultural.

41:17.440 --> 41:20.520
Jews cannot pray alone

41:20.520 --> 41:22.420
most of the prayers.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.480
There's so many people alone.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.180
You're required to pray in dominion,

41:27.620 --> 41:29.780
which is often translated as a quorum,

41:29.780 --> 41:32.200
which is traditionally a group

41:32.200 --> 41:34.220
of ten adult Jewish men.

41:35.100 --> 41:37.060
Today, we will usually let women

41:37.060 --> 41:38.080
be part of the dominion.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.280
Thanks.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.260
You're not allowed to do

41:45.260 --> 41:47.740
morning practices by yourself.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.000
If your mom or dad dies,

41:51.160 --> 41:53.300
you have to pray the morning prayers

41:53.300 --> 41:54.140
in a dominion.

41:54.800 --> 41:57.100
You're not allowed to practice that

41:57.100 --> 41:58.260
in isolation.

41:59.780 --> 42:01.260
So, you have to go to the temple?

42:02.260 --> 42:02.660
Yes.

42:02.980 --> 42:03.100
Yeah.

42:03.220 --> 42:03.580
Currently.

42:04.400 --> 42:04.780
Currently.

42:05.300 --> 42:07.540
We don't have a temple temple anymore.

42:07.840 --> 42:08.900
So, you'd have to find

42:08.900 --> 42:10.360
like your local synagogue,

42:11.120 --> 42:13.980
which sometimes we will call a temple.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.400
A better translation would be

42:17.400 --> 42:18.980
a house of prayer.

42:21.180 --> 42:22.440
So, yeah.

42:23.520 --> 42:25.220
You can pray at homes

42:25.220 --> 42:27.000
or does it have to be at the synagogue?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.960
It can be anywhere

42:28.960 --> 42:30.480
as long as you have a minion.

42:31.840 --> 42:32.880
Of mostly men.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.320
Depends on how orthodox you are.

42:36.720 --> 42:37.900
Well, that's my question.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.880
So, when you say more focused

42:39.880 --> 42:41.040
on action than belief,

42:41.760 --> 42:44.580
what would an orthodox rabbi say?

42:44.720 --> 42:46.300
Think of that bullet point.

42:46.520 --> 42:47.360
Would they agree with you?

42:48.540 --> 42:49.840
An orthodox is stricter?

42:50.280 --> 42:52.280
Just so I know what you're...

42:52.280 --> 42:54.040
I just want to clarify.

42:54.760 --> 42:55.500
Versus reform.

42:56.400 --> 42:56.800
Right.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.820
There's three major branches of Judaism

42:58.820 --> 43:01.040
today in America.

43:01.260 --> 43:02.400
We have the modern orthodox,

43:02.520 --> 43:03.060
the conservative,

43:03.260 --> 43:03.980
and the reform.

43:04.500 --> 43:06.240
I won't get too much into the history,

43:06.780 --> 43:08.040
but they all have

43:08.040 --> 43:09.640
different positions

43:09.640 --> 43:10.800
about the Jewish law,

43:10.900 --> 43:12.240
and that's the key differentiation.

43:12.240 --> 43:15.760
So, is Jewish law binding?

43:15.980 --> 43:16.740
Are we required

43:16.740 --> 43:17.940
to follow Jewish law?

43:18.380 --> 43:20.040
And, can Jewish law

43:20.040 --> 43:20.800
change over time?

43:21.060 --> 43:22.000
Are we allowed

43:22.000 --> 43:25.140
to reinterpret

43:25.140 --> 43:26.540
the law

43:26.540 --> 43:28.320
in response

43:28.320 --> 43:29.340
to our changing times?

43:30.020 --> 43:31.360
So, the modern orthodox

43:31.360 --> 43:32.220
basically say,

43:32.600 --> 43:33.740
yes, Jewish law is binding,

43:34.340 --> 43:35.840
and no, it does not change.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.220
So, they are very

43:37.220 --> 43:39.100
conservative,

43:39.540 --> 43:41.180
very much sticks in the mud.

43:42.240 --> 43:43.820
The conservative movement

43:43.820 --> 43:44.940
is kind of a middle ground.

43:45.340 --> 43:46.620
Yes, the law is binding.

43:46.740 --> 43:47.760
You have to follow the law,

43:47.960 --> 43:49.660
but we can change it

43:49.660 --> 43:50.740
in response to

43:50.740 --> 43:53.960
our evolving understanding

43:53.960 --> 43:54.620
of humanity

43:54.620 --> 43:56.220
and society.

43:57.040 --> 43:57.640
Reform

43:57.640 --> 43:58.680
are

43:58.680 --> 44:00.160
very loosey-goosey.

44:01.380 --> 44:03.080
The law is not binding.

44:03.240 --> 44:04.420
It's more of a suggestion,

44:04.860 --> 44:06.780
and it's subject to change.

44:06.880 --> 44:07.900
We can adapt it.

44:07.900 --> 44:13.120
So, the modern orthodox

44:13.120 --> 44:14.980
would still agree

44:14.980 --> 44:16.280
that action is much more

44:16.280 --> 44:17.180
important than belief.

44:19.820 --> 44:22.180
But they might think

44:22.180 --> 44:23.460
that a lot of the,

44:23.940 --> 44:24.440
for example,

44:24.560 --> 44:25.180
atheist Jews

44:25.180 --> 44:26.900
are crazy.

44:26.900 --> 44:30.140
So, that would be

44:30.140 --> 44:31.500
under the last cow.

44:33.220 --> 44:33.880
The crazies?

44:34.120 --> 44:34.980
The crazy people.

44:35.580 --> 44:36.180
You're just saying

44:36.180 --> 44:36.580
reform.

44:37.560 --> 44:37.760
Yeah.

44:37.760 --> 44:38.940
They'd probably be

44:38.940 --> 44:40.040
considered more reform,

44:40.200 --> 44:41.020
but I, yeah.

44:41.360 --> 44:41.680
Yes?

44:42.380 --> 44:43.540
Well, I'm focusing

44:43.540 --> 44:44.400
on the word action.

44:45.000 --> 44:45.960
So, when you say

44:45.960 --> 44:46.760
an orthodox

44:46.760 --> 44:48.100
would still believe

44:48.100 --> 44:48.580
that action

44:48.580 --> 44:49.380
is more important

44:49.380 --> 44:49.760
than belief,

44:49.880 --> 44:50.100
what's,

44:50.200 --> 44:51.540
is that action like,

44:52.360 --> 44:53.200
like following

44:53.200 --> 44:53.900
the rituals?

44:53.900 --> 44:54.600
rituals?

44:55.200 --> 44:55.420
Yeah.

44:55.540 --> 44:56.240
For the orthodox,

44:56.320 --> 44:57.680
it would primarily be

44:57.680 --> 45:00.500
doing the three daily prayers,

45:01.240 --> 45:02.220
keeping kosher,

45:03.240 --> 45:05.420
making sure

45:05.420 --> 45:06.060
that you

45:06.060 --> 45:07.680
don't touch

45:07.680 --> 45:08.440
dead bodies

45:08.440 --> 45:09.120
or lizards

45:09.120 --> 45:10.100
or whatever.

45:12.580 --> 45:14.340
But not on good works.

45:15.800 --> 45:16.980
Not so much

45:16.980 --> 45:17.860
for the orthodox,

45:18.660 --> 45:19.400
but the further

45:19.400 --> 45:19.840
you get

45:19.840 --> 45:20.400
to the right

45:20.400 --> 45:21.100
of this chart,

45:21.100 --> 45:22.860
the less

45:22.860 --> 45:23.900
that they're worried

45:23.900 --> 45:24.860
about the sort

45:24.860 --> 45:25.500
of traditional

45:25.500 --> 45:27.280
laws

45:27.280 --> 45:27.800
and the more

45:27.800 --> 45:28.400
that they're worried

45:28.400 --> 45:29.380
about the more

45:29.380 --> 45:30.360
social justice

45:30.360 --> 45:31.120
part of it,

45:31.380 --> 45:32.340
the prophetic,

45:32.880 --> 45:34.160
I don't care

45:34.160 --> 45:35.120
about your fasts,

45:35.160 --> 45:35.860
help the poor.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.360
Clothing,

45:38.560 --> 45:39.020
clothing

45:39.020 --> 45:40.600
and hair.

45:41.520 --> 45:41.720
Yeah,

45:41.760 --> 45:42.780
that's more on this side,

45:42.940 --> 45:44.600
the clothing requirements.

45:45.520 --> 45:46.960
This just is reminding me

45:46.960 --> 45:48.160
of Christianity today

45:48.160 --> 45:49.880
with the extreme

45:49.880 --> 45:51.820
conservative fundamentalists

45:51.820 --> 45:53.000
who would have

45:53.000 --> 45:54.240
stormed out of here

45:54.240 --> 45:54.900
when you said

45:54.900 --> 45:55.760
anything at all

45:55.760 --> 45:56.340
about whether

45:56.340 --> 45:57.380
Jesus existed

45:57.380 --> 45:58.160
or not

45:58.160 --> 46:00.900
because the Bible

46:00.900 --> 46:02.600
is inerrant,

46:02.780 --> 46:03.320
infallible

46:03.320 --> 46:05.000
and has no

46:05.000 --> 46:06.020
contradictions in it.

46:06.120 --> 46:06.260
I mean,

46:06.300 --> 46:07.300
that's their position

46:07.300 --> 46:08.040
and so the law

46:08.040 --> 46:08.640
is everything

46:08.640 --> 46:10.060
and your belief

46:10.060 --> 46:10.500
is everything.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.400
But on the other side,

46:11.500 --> 46:11.800
it would be like

46:11.800 --> 46:13.160
the UCC for sure

46:13.160 --> 46:14.360
and the Presbyterians

46:14.360 --> 46:15.620
to a degree

46:15.620 --> 46:17.060
that we're going

46:17.060 --> 46:18.160
to put social justice

46:18.160 --> 46:19.640
and human needs first.

46:20.380 --> 46:21.520
So would you say

46:21.520 --> 46:22.880
we're more reform?

46:23.320 --> 46:23.480
Sure.

46:24.000 --> 46:24.600
As Christians,

46:25.000 --> 46:25.320
oh yeah,

46:25.400 --> 46:26.140
because the folks

46:26.140 --> 46:27.060
on the left,

46:27.380 --> 46:28.740
on this chart that is,

46:29.240 --> 46:29.980
don't even think

46:29.980 --> 46:31.040
that progressive Christians

46:31.040 --> 46:32.080
are Christians at all.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.320
They think we're going to hell

46:33.320 --> 46:35.160
because we don't believe

46:35.160 --> 46:36.100
the way they believe.

46:36.740 --> 46:37.480
They're very rigid

46:37.480 --> 46:38.840
and that's who's

46:38.840 --> 46:39.760
in power right now.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.160
That mindset

46:41.160 --> 46:43.140
is the powerful mindset

46:43.140 --> 46:44.340
in our country.

46:44.340 --> 46:45.040
In fact,

46:45.100 --> 46:45.920
the modern orthodox

46:45.920 --> 46:47.260
wouldn't even consider me Jewish

46:47.260 --> 46:47.900
because I had

46:47.900 --> 46:49.240
conservative conversion

46:49.240 --> 46:50.980
and that is not

46:50.980 --> 46:51.960
strict enough for them.

46:52.200 --> 46:52.400
Bless you.

46:53.260 --> 46:54.080
So are there different

46:54.080 --> 46:54.920
synagogues

46:54.920 --> 46:55.900
with these different,

46:56.340 --> 46:57.340
you can be a

46:57.340 --> 46:58.500
conservative

46:58.500 --> 47:00.500
synagogue

47:00.500 --> 47:02.200
or you can be a reform.

47:02.680 --> 47:03.760
For the most part,

47:04.120 --> 47:07.240
a Jew is a Jew

47:07.240 --> 47:08.540
and you can go

47:08.540 --> 47:09.920
to wherever you want.

47:09.920 --> 47:10.820
This is

47:10.820 --> 47:14.020
more at

47:14.020 --> 47:15.880
like an institutional level

47:15.880 --> 47:16.660
of,

47:18.660 --> 47:19.500
you know,

47:19.560 --> 47:20.280
there's like a bunch

47:20.280 --> 47:20.840
of rabbis

47:20.840 --> 47:21.740
in a building somewhere

47:21.740 --> 47:23.180
making rules

47:23.180 --> 47:24.160
and publishing books

47:24.160 --> 47:24.680
and stuff

47:24.680 --> 47:26.660
but most everyday Jews

47:26.660 --> 47:27.740
just don't really care

47:27.740 --> 47:28.220
that much

47:28.220 --> 47:28.840
and will go to

47:28.840 --> 47:29.560
whatever synagogue

47:29.560 --> 47:30.300
is closest.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.280
So if you

47:33.280 --> 47:34.220
walk

47:34.220 --> 47:35.780
to synagogue,

47:35.780 --> 47:37.880
does that mean

47:37.880 --> 47:39.040
you're at least

47:39.040 --> 47:39.700
a conservative?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.640
Would the reformed Jews

47:42.640 --> 47:43.560
consider that

47:43.560 --> 47:44.320
this idea

47:44.320 --> 47:45.600
of not doing

47:45.600 --> 47:46.420
work,

47:46.840 --> 47:47.660
not starting

47:47.660 --> 47:48.400
your car,

47:49.540 --> 47:50.720
would they go

47:50.720 --> 47:51.100
for that

47:51.100 --> 47:51.540
or is that

47:51.540 --> 47:52.440
a conservative Jew?

47:52.440 --> 47:58.360
The car issue

47:58.360 --> 47:58.900
is not really

47:58.900 --> 47:59.600
a work issue.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.140
It's about

48:00.140 --> 48:00.960
kindling fire

48:00.960 --> 48:01.460
on the Sabbath

48:01.460 --> 48:03.520
or carrying

48:03.520 --> 48:04.120
on the Sabbath

48:04.120 --> 48:05.160
which are two

48:05.160 --> 48:06.320
other prohibitions

48:06.320 --> 48:07.340
that you're not

48:07.340 --> 48:07.740
allowed to do

48:07.740 --> 48:08.120
those things

48:08.120 --> 48:08.580
on the Sabbath.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.020
Modern Orthodox,

48:12.340 --> 48:12.940
you definitely

48:12.940 --> 48:13.560
are not allowed

48:13.560 --> 48:14.180
to drive a car.

48:15.880 --> 48:16.760
The leaders

48:16.760 --> 48:17.460
of the conservative

48:17.460 --> 48:17.940
movement

48:17.940 --> 48:20.020
made a ruling

48:20.020 --> 48:21.000
some years ago

48:21.000 --> 48:21.920
that

48:21.920 --> 48:23.280
it's better

48:23.280 --> 48:23.760
for you

48:23.760 --> 48:24.380
to go

48:24.380 --> 48:25.020
to synagogue

48:25.020 --> 48:26.040
than not.

48:26.600 --> 48:27.200
So if you

48:27.200 --> 48:28.120
must drive

48:28.120 --> 48:28.940
to get to

48:28.940 --> 48:29.200
synagogue

48:29.200 --> 48:30.180
then you can

48:30.180 --> 48:31.960
but you probably

48:31.960 --> 48:32.380
shouldn't be

48:32.380 --> 48:33.240
driving anywhere else.

48:33.920 --> 48:34.360
That kind of

48:34.360 --> 48:34.720
sounds like

48:34.720 --> 48:35.720
an Amish people.

48:37.380 --> 48:38.160
So with not

48:38.160 --> 48:39.040
using the power,

48:40.060 --> 48:40.980
the energy

48:40.980 --> 48:41.620
that is only

48:41.620 --> 48:42.080
on Sabbath.

48:43.640 --> 48:44.860
Electric cars

48:44.860 --> 48:45.780
are fine.

48:46.540 --> 48:46.920
Really?

48:50.500 --> 48:51.100
Because

48:51.100 --> 48:52.460
it's kindling

48:52.460 --> 48:53.460
fire that

48:53.460 --> 48:54.020
is prohibited.

48:54.200 --> 48:54.720
So the spark

48:54.720 --> 48:55.100
flag

48:55.100 --> 48:56.000
or the...

48:56.000 --> 48:56.200
Yeah,

48:56.500 --> 48:57.480
internal combustion

48:57.480 --> 48:58.120
engines are all...

48:58.120 --> 48:58.920
But without using

48:58.920 --> 49:00.000
lights in the house,

49:00.140 --> 49:01.280
isn't that considered

49:01.280 --> 49:03.560
by the Orthodox...

49:03.560 --> 49:04.240
Modern Orthodox,

49:04.740 --> 49:06.100
for some reason,

49:06.560 --> 49:07.140
have decided

49:07.140 --> 49:07.980
that electricity

49:07.980 --> 49:08.640
is fire.

49:09.600 --> 49:09.960
Yes.

49:10.380 --> 49:11.180
Nobody else

49:11.180 --> 49:11.540
agrees.

49:11.980 --> 49:12.280
Okay.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.080
Weird.

49:14.580 --> 49:14.780
Yeah.

49:15.440 --> 49:15.620
Yeah.

49:17.980 --> 49:18.980
So you can go back

49:18.980 --> 49:19.800
to what you were saying.

49:20.340 --> 49:20.700
I don't know

49:20.700 --> 49:21.300
what I was saying.

49:21.440 --> 49:22.020
What was I saying?

49:25.360 --> 49:25.800
Alright,

49:25.920 --> 49:26.600
so traditionally

49:26.600 --> 49:28.160
Judaism is transmitted

49:28.160 --> 49:30.000
by the mother.

49:30.340 --> 49:31.040
So if your mom

49:31.040 --> 49:31.540
is Jewish

49:31.540 --> 49:32.000
then you're

49:32.000 --> 49:33.060
automatically Jewish.

49:33.840 --> 49:34.720
Different positions

49:34.720 --> 49:35.400
on this now.

49:35.520 --> 49:36.060
Most people

49:36.060 --> 49:36.640
will say that

49:36.640 --> 49:37.260
if either of your

49:37.260 --> 49:38.620
parents was Jewish

49:38.620 --> 49:40.120
and you were

49:40.120 --> 49:41.720
exposed to Judaism

49:41.720 --> 49:42.500
growing up

49:42.500 --> 49:43.580
then you count.

49:45.500 --> 49:46.360
Converting to...

49:46.360 --> 49:46.640
Yes.

49:46.840 --> 49:47.800
Can I ask a question?

49:48.020 --> 49:48.280
Yes.

49:49.220 --> 49:49.540
Okay,

49:49.640 --> 49:50.760
so my grandfather

49:50.760 --> 49:51.820
was Jewish

49:51.820 --> 49:52.960
and my grandmother

49:52.960 --> 49:53.880
wasn't.

49:54.120 --> 49:54.420
Mm-hmm.

49:55.800 --> 49:57.480
Does that affect

49:57.480 --> 49:59.000
my grandfather's

49:59.000 --> 49:59.680
Judaism

49:59.680 --> 50:00.420
or...

50:03.220 --> 50:04.440
Is the question

50:04.440 --> 50:05.100
does marrying

50:05.100 --> 50:05.600
a non-Jew

50:05.600 --> 50:06.480
make him less Jewish?

50:07.900 --> 50:08.540
Does he...

50:08.540 --> 50:10.140
He stays Jewish,

50:10.180 --> 50:10.520
right?

50:10.800 --> 50:11.060
Yes.

50:11.240 --> 50:11.580
Okay.

50:12.360 --> 50:12.580
You know,

50:12.620 --> 50:13.200
you can't stop

50:13.200 --> 50:13.740
being Jewish.

50:14.640 --> 50:15.160
Okay.

50:15.460 --> 50:16.120
You couldn't

50:16.120 --> 50:16.860
convert to another

50:16.860 --> 50:17.240
religion?

50:18.320 --> 50:18.960
I could,

50:19.080 --> 50:19.500
but I wouldn't

50:19.500 --> 50:20.320
stop being a Jew.

50:20.640 --> 50:21.660
I would just be

50:21.660 --> 50:23.000
an apostate.

50:23.380 --> 50:24.220
A non-Jew

50:24.220 --> 50:25.420
not a person

50:25.420 --> 50:27.020
or an apostate?

50:27.300 --> 50:28.040
Is that a Christian

50:28.040 --> 50:29.960
or Christian Jews

50:29.960 --> 50:30.980
or some Christian Jews?

50:31.660 --> 50:32.180
Yeah,

50:32.320 --> 50:32.740
there are.

50:33.040 --> 50:33.260
Yeah.

50:33.600 --> 50:33.820
Yeah.

50:35.100 --> 50:36.280
There are a lot

50:36.280 --> 50:37.060
of Buddhist Jews.

50:38.060 --> 50:39.220
A whole lot

50:39.220 --> 50:40.020
of Buddhist Jews.

50:40.860 --> 50:41.380
We call them

50:41.380 --> 50:41.900
Jubus.

50:42.500 --> 50:42.780
Oh!

50:42.780 --> 50:42.940
Oh!

50:44.940 --> 50:47.280
But don't repeat

50:47.280 --> 50:47.580
that.

50:49.100 --> 50:50.080
That's our word.

50:52.120 --> 50:52.680
So,

50:52.840 --> 50:54.420
converting to Judaism

50:54.420 --> 50:56.360
is quite different

50:56.360 --> 50:57.180
than Christianity.

50:58.660 --> 50:59.220
Especially,

50:59.560 --> 51:00.220
for some reason,

51:00.360 --> 51:00.520
like,

51:00.560 --> 51:01.660
the more conservative

51:01.660 --> 51:02.220
Christian,

51:02.400 --> 51:03.200
the easier it is

51:03.200 --> 51:04.520
to become Christian.

51:04.520 --> 51:04.860
like,

51:04.900 --> 51:05.480
you just pray

51:05.480 --> 51:06.860
the prayer,

51:07.120 --> 51:07.300
like,

51:07.360 --> 51:08.040
I accept Jesus

51:08.040 --> 51:08.720
into my heart

51:08.720 --> 51:09.060
and boom,

51:09.120 --> 51:09.640
you're Christian.

51:12.080 --> 51:13.000
For Judaism,

51:14.100 --> 51:15.540
if anybody remembers

51:15.540 --> 51:16.040
the,

51:16.440 --> 51:16.920
what is it called,

51:17.020 --> 51:17.960
confirmation classes,

51:18.440 --> 51:19.220
that kind of stuff,

51:19.480 --> 51:20.300
it's sort of like that.

51:20.440 --> 51:22.460
We generally have to spend

51:22.460 --> 51:23.580
at least a year

51:23.580 --> 51:24.760
studying Judaism,

51:25.000 --> 51:25.760
learning all the

51:25.760 --> 51:27.500
laws and the

51:27.500 --> 51:28.020
traditions

51:28.020 --> 51:28.780
and the practices

51:28.780 --> 51:29.760
and the customs

51:29.760 --> 51:32.080
and the history.

51:32.600 --> 51:33.380
So it's more like

51:33.380 --> 51:34.460
trying to get

51:34.460 --> 51:35.000
citizenship

51:35.000 --> 51:36.280
in a new country

51:36.280 --> 51:38.480
where you have to

51:38.480 --> 51:39.180
live in the country

51:39.180 --> 51:39.780
for a while

51:39.780 --> 51:40.340
and then you have

51:40.340 --> 51:41.140
to take an exam.

51:41.800 --> 51:42.600
When I converted,

51:42.740 --> 51:43.420
I had to sit

51:43.420 --> 51:45.160
in front of a

51:45.160 --> 51:46.420
Jewish court

51:46.420 --> 51:47.660
of three rabbis

51:47.660 --> 51:49.240
and they asked me

51:49.240 --> 51:49.740
questions

51:49.740 --> 51:50.540
and I had to

51:50.540 --> 51:52.000
prove that I knew

51:52.000 --> 51:53.040
what I was talking about

51:53.040 --> 51:54.240
and I'm sincere.

51:54.240 --> 51:56.680
before I was alive.

51:57.120 --> 51:57.280
Yeah.

51:57.860 --> 51:58.900
Oh, there was a lot

51:58.900 --> 51:59.300
of pressure.

52:00.140 --> 52:01.560
I dabbed like an idiot.

52:02.340 --> 52:03.460
Without being a smart

52:03.460 --> 52:03.960
aleck, right?

52:05.480 --> 52:06.840
I was still a smart aleck.

52:07.940 --> 52:09.240
Do you read Hebrew?

52:09.600 --> 52:10.520
Is that a requirement?

52:11.420 --> 52:12.040
Reading Hebrew

52:12.040 --> 52:12.620
is a requirement

52:12.620 --> 52:13.500
for the modern Orthodox.

52:15.660 --> 52:18.000
I cannot read Hebrew.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.460
I can sort of

52:19.460 --> 52:20.080
sound things out

52:20.080 --> 52:20.540
a little bit

52:20.540 --> 52:21.360
but a lot of the letters

52:21.360 --> 52:21.900
look the same

52:21.900 --> 52:22.380
and the vowels

52:22.380 --> 52:23.000
are really hard

52:23.000 --> 52:23.580
to figure out.

52:23.580 --> 52:25.240
But that's the end

52:25.240 --> 52:25.820
of my slides.

52:26.240 --> 52:26.800
Okay, there.

52:26.960 --> 52:27.480
That was perfect.

52:28.020 --> 52:29.060
That's very nice.

52:29.340 --> 52:29.760
Very good.

52:29.900 --> 52:30.940
Thank you.

52:31.080 --> 52:31.280
Yeah.

52:31.500 --> 52:32.200
That was interesting.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.420
I missed a lot of it.

52:35.500 --> 52:36.040
Thank you.

52:36.040 --> 52:36.440
Yay.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.920
Thank you.

52:38.920 --> 52:39.000
Thank you.

52:39.720 --> 52:40.600
Next time,

52:40.680 --> 52:41.640
I think I will

52:41.640 --> 52:42.740
focus more

52:42.740 --> 52:44.460
on some of the

52:44.460 --> 52:46.120
common Jewish practices

52:46.120 --> 52:46.960
like what is

52:46.960 --> 52:47.900
Jewish prayer like?

52:48.480 --> 52:49.120
What's the deal

52:49.120 --> 52:50.100
with the funny hats

52:50.100 --> 52:51.600
and the clothes

52:51.600 --> 52:52.080
and stuff?

52:52.340 --> 52:52.720
Oh, yeah.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.880
That kind of thing.

52:54.840 --> 52:55.100
Mm-hmm.

52:55.100 --> 52:56.040
That kind of thing.

52:56.040 --> 52:56.360
So...

52:56.360 --> 53:26.340
Thank you.
