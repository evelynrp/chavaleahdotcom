Computers are confusing, and learning how to effectively set up and manage devices can take a long time. It doesn't help that everything from your doorbell to your car is computerized, and a lot of the resources out there use specialized jargon that's impossible to understand.

I offer IT Support services to friends and community members. I am a Google-certified IT Support Professional and have been CompTIA A+ certified.

Luckily, I grew up in the "computer age" and have been deploying, hardening, and maintaining my own fleet of devices for over a decade (since I was 12 years old!). Whatever you're having issues with, I'm at least moderately well-prepared to deal with it! 

## How I Can Help

- Buying new computers or devices at a good price
- Setting up new devices
- Migrating from an old device to a new one
- Smart appliances
- Home automation
- Virus prevention and recovery
- Technological black magic and man-made horrors beyond your comprehension

## Money Talk

I don't do this for money, but because it's fun, I want to keep my skills sharp, and I want to give back to my community. That said, I don't charge for my services.

**This is a pay-what-you-want service.**

If I need to buy parts, I will charge you the *actual amount that I paid for them*.

I accept most forms of payment, including cash, card, and cryptocurrency.
