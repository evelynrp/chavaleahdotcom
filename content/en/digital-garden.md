A digital garden is an online space for cultivating ideas in a fluid and dynamic way. Rather than a traditional personal blog, in which posts are expected to be static entities that don't change, digital gardens resemble the hyperlink-riddled chaos of early web pages. This more accurately represents the organic nature of communication, which is rarely so rigidly linear.

## How to Navigate This Site

Content on this site is organized into three taxa (that's the plural form of taxon, or a taxonomic group): series, categories, and tags. Works in a series are intended to be consumed together in a more or less linear fashion, usually starting with the oldest and ending with the newest. Categories are, well, broad topical categories. Each article on this site belongs to only one category. Tags are similar to categories but are more fine-tuned. An article may belong to many tags.

Content on this site is also dynamic: it changes over time. To reflect this, each article is represented by one of three stages of growth: seedling, blooming, and evergreen. A seedling is a work in its beginning stages---it may consist of little more than an outline---and is represented by the emoji ðŸŒ±. An article which is blooming has more meat on its bones, but is not quite fully mature, and is represented by the emoji ðŸŒ¼. An evergreen article is more or less complete, and is represented by the emoji ðŸŒ³. The bottom of each article includes a Redaction History, which is a record of changes.
