# What Do Jews Think about Jesus?

## The Historical Jesus

## Rabbinic Period

## Today

Many articles written by Christian sources will assert that Jews reject Jesus as Messiah and deny his divinity. This phrasing is misleading; it makes it sound like rejecting and denying are things Jews are actively doing. In truth, most Jews don't go out of their way to think about Jesus in one way or another.

We do, however, live in a largely Christian society, and therefore must, by necessity, spend at least some time and mental effort distinguishing Judaism from the dominant Christian culture. This process is largely a matter of culture and identity, rather than one of religious belief. The average Jew does not celebrate Christmas, and, if asked "Why not?" will reply, "Because Jews don't believe in Jesus." This answer must, however, be prompted by a society in which the celebration of Christian is the cultural norm. Jews are perfectly happy celebrating our own religious festivals. I don't think about Christmas until somebody asks me why I don't celebrate it. It is this failure to assimilate into dominant Christian cultural practices that comes closest to the modern Jew's rejecting of Jesus.

Do Jews today view Jesus as divine? No. Not because we dislike Jesus, but because it would be idolatrous according to our interpretation of Torah. Do we accept him as Messiah? Also no. But this is not so unusual: we don't accept Sabbatai Zevi, Simon bar Kokhba, Moses of Crete, Abu Isa, Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia, or any number of other claimants either.

The short answer to the question, "What do Jews think about Jesus?" is, "We don't."

# Did the Jews Kill Jesus?

As discussed above, there is no consensus over whether Jesus was a real historical figure. For the sake of answering this question, we will treat the Gospel narratives as being more or less reliable historical accounts, and consider contemporary historical evidence to analyze the political forces at work in the crucifixion.

## Second Temple Politics

### Pharisees, Sadducees, and Zealots

### Rebellions Against Rome
