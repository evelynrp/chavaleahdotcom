## Historical Background

In Jesus's day, Judaism was in a time of significant change and upheaval. Second Temple religion and politics were a struggle between three major factions. The Sadducees represented the priestly Temple cult; the Pharisees advocated for a legalistic or scribal cult born in the Babylonian exile; and the Zealots were a military faction intent on Judean independence from Rome.

### The Maccabees

Judea's location on the Mediterranean coast and between Egypt and Asia Minor make it militarily and economically valuable. Following the death of Alexander the Great, his successors competed for control of the region. The various ruling classes of Judea invariably sided with different Hellenistic factions, seeing political and economic advantages. As a result, Hellenism became increasingly appealing to Judean aristocrats. Greek replaced Hebrew, kosher laws were ignored, a hymnasium was built in which Jews competed in Hellenistic athletic games nude, and circumcisions were either not performed or reversed.

While the ruling classes were in support of Hellenization, the common farmers and laborers were loathe to surrender the god and traditions of their fathers. Tensions came to a head when Antiochus looted the Temple in Jerusalem in 170 BCE. A faction of guerilla rebel fighters formed under Mattathias, and later his son, Judas Maccabee, who "tore down altars, circumcised Jewish children that had been left uncircumcised, and exhorted Jews everywhere to join in the revolt".

The Maccabean Revolt was successful. The Temple was cleansed, all remnants of unclean or idolatrous practices were purged, and proper sacrifices were resumed in 165 BCE. Judas Maccabees, seeing Rome's policy of relative self-governance as the most favorable to ensure Judean religion's long-term survival, allied Judea with Rome, making Judea a Roman vassal state.

The priestly line, disrupted by Hellenization, had to be reinstated. Judas's own descendant, Simon Maccabeus, would take control of the Temple and priestly duties, establishing the Hasmonean Dynasty.

### The Sadducees

There is much debate, both today and in conflicting historical sources, over the niche the Sadducees occupied. What we can say with relativve certainty is that the Sadducees were supporters of the Hasmonean priestly line and were primarily concerned with maintaining the Temple cult.

When defining the Sadducees, it is helpful to consider them in the frameworks of political and economic class. In contrast with the more apolitical Pharisees, the Sadducees saw the continuation of the Temple cult as dependent on politics. Thus, they engaged in poligical negotiations with Rome in order to protect priestly interests, earning them a reputation as Roman collaborators. Economically, they represented the aristocratic class, maintaining their position through crude power. The Pharisees, by contrast, represented the more mild-mannered and charismatic mercantile class. In essence, the Sadducees were preservers of the status quo.

### The Pharisees

Prior to the destruction of the First Temple in 587 BCE, Judean religious practice was centered on the Temple cult. Sacrifices and festivals were centralized at the Temple in Jerusalem and were under the purview of a heriditary priestly class, the descendants of Aaron and Levi.

During the Babylonian Exile, the period of time between Babylon's conquest of Judea and the restoration of the Temple under Cyrus the Great in 516 BCE, Temple sacrifices were impossible. In order to maintain their identity as a distinct people and maintain their devotion to Yahweh, a new form of Judean religion, centered instead around the Book of the Law, was developed. Temple sacrifice was replaced by prayer, priestly duties by individual observance of the *mitzvot*, or commandments. This "portable Judaism" became the basis of Pharisaism, and the sect gained momentum as the power of the Hasmonean priests waned.

Another characteristic of the Pharisees was their insistence on separateness. They took very seriously the Levitical purity codes, a series of rules and prohibitions related to ritual purity. In order to live in strict alignment with the Book of the Law, the Pharisees saw it necessary to separate themselves from Gentiles, and even from non-Pharisees. This ensured that they would not come into contact with unclean foods, substances, or practices.

### The Zealots

The militaristic zeal which the Maccabees inspired did not vanish with the establishment of the Hasmonean Dynasty. Guerilla bands continued to occupy the Judean Hill Country, carrying out small-scale raids against what they considered Rome and her collaborators. This militaristic trend culminated in a rebellion against Rome in 66 BCE, and the total destruction of the Second Temple and the Judean state in 70 CE.

## What Jesus Said

Now that we have an idea of what Judaism looked like in the time of Jesus, we can make sense of some of the things Jesus said about his contemporaries in the Gospel accounts.

### The Sadducees

{{< marginpar >}}Matthew 22:23, Mark 12:18, Luke 20:27{{< /marginpar >}}
The Gospels reference the Sadducees independently of the Pharisees only in regards to one incident, in which the Sadducees ask a weirdly specific legal question about marriage post-resurrection. The question is pretty clearly a trap to try to get Jesus to say something stupid, which is a common motif in the Gospel narratives. It's not terribly helpful to answer our question. Instead, we have to infer his attitude indirectly.
