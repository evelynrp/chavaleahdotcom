## Did the Jews Kill Jesus?

{{< marginpar >}}Accusations of deicide have followed Jews for millenia. We're going to get into the details, but let me say up front: please stop.{{< /marginpar >}}
As discussed above, there is no consensus over whether Jesus was a real historical figure. For the sake of answering this question, we will treat the Gospel narratives as being more or less reliable historical accounts, and consider contemporary historical evidence to analyze the political forces at work in the crucifixion.

### Second Temple Politics

#### Pharisees, Sadducees, and Zealots

#### Rebellions Against Rome

### The Gospel Accounts

Most readers are likely familiar with the Gospels' accounts of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus is arrested, brought before the chief priests and accused, then brought before Pilate and tried, and then crucified. The Gospels generally give rather detailed accounts of these events. This is surprising, because, in all likelihood, none of these events took place!

Jesus was executed by crucifixion, which was a common method of torture and execution used by the Romans... So the execution of Jesus was a Roman affair, possibly with the cooperation of the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem. The Romans did not need to try a troublesome Jewish peasant in order to kill him. They tortured and crucified nameless lower-class people all the time. In order to get rid of Jesus, who had caused a disturbance in the temple, had made radical-sounding pronouncements and prophecies, and was rumored to have aspirations to kingship, the Romans would have simply taken him by force and crucified him the next day along with a few others they were getting rid of. There was no need for any trial, much less two or more before different "courts." It would have been more trouble than a Roman governor needed for the desired result.
