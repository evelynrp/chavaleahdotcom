title: "Contact"
---

Contact methods are sorted into tiers based on how likely I am to check for messages on that platform. Preference is given according to three criteria:

1. Whether the platform is open source.
2. Whether the platform supports zero-access end-to-end encryption.
3. Whether the platform is decentralized.

Please note that, due to uncertainty about the future of the Android Open Source Project, some contact methods may become unavailable in the future. For example, if it becomes the case that GrapheneOS is unable to continue development and no viable open source alternative presents itself, platforms tied to smartphone access such as Signal and WhatsApp may be dropped to Tier 4.
