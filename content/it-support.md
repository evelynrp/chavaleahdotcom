## About

I offer IT Support services to friends and community members.

I am a Google-certified IT Support Professional and have been CompTIA A+ certified. Computers are confusing, and learning how to effectively set up and manage devices can take a long time. It doesn't help that everything from your doorbell to your car is computerized, and a lot of the resources out there use specialized jargon that's impossible to understand.

Luckily, I grew up in the "computer age" and have been deploying, hardening, and maintaining my own fleet of devices for over a decade (since I was 12 years old!). Whatever you're having issues with, I'm at least moderately well-prepared to deal with it! 

## How I Can Help

Here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past:

- Windows --- I've done everything from installation to security hardening to automating software deployment and updates
- Linux --- all of the above, plus setting up drivers, udev rules, and printers; I'm also familiar with cli tools and window managers (i3, bspwm, sway, hyprland); I have experience with Arch, Debian and derivatives, Fedora, Universal Blue, and a few niche distros like Chimera and Gentoo
- Android --- I regularly use adb debugging, app sideloading, alternate app stores, and custom Roms (I have used LineageOS in the past and currently run GrapheneOS)
- Raspberry Pi --- I have set up rpi's with pi-hole, AdGuard Home, and RetroPie
- Self-hosted Services --- I have hosted services like Plex, Jellyfin, Servarr
- Security --- I'm experienced with password managers like LastPass, Bitwarden, Keepass, and `pass`, physical security keys like the YubiKey, OnlyKey, and SoloKey, firewalls, DNS sinkholes, and the like
- Hardware Provisioning --- I can't tell you how many times somebody I know has grossly overpaid for a new computer, tablet, phone, or whatever; I can almost guarantee I'll find you a better deal

## Money Talk

I don't do this for money, but because it's fun, I want to keep my skills sharp, and I want to give back to my community. That said, I don't charge for my services.

**This is a pay-what-you-want service.**

If I need to buy parts, I will charge you the *actual amount that I paid for them*.
